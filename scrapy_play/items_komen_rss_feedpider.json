It seems a doomed path for a mastectomy and chemo though of course the choice always remains with the patient. Has anyone else been through something similar? Am I correct in assuming I am foolish if I do not do a mastectomy? And, if your going to do one, i might  as well be both, right? I feeli like I am drowning.

Komen has established its website moderator program in an effort to effectively and efficiently monitor the content posted in the Forums and manage comments and complaints that are received from the Forum subscribers and the public with respect to such content.  Komen has established the Forums in support of the Promise so that its subscribers could network on-line to freely share their breast cancer stories, to ask questions, to give answers and to support each other personally in their daily lives.  However, Komen must balance each subscriber's freedom of speech with its obligations to other subscribers and the public to ensure that the Forums are being used in a manner to promote the Promise and not for any illegal, offensive, infringing, defamatory, inaccurate, objectionable or commercial purposes.  As such, Komen has reserved the right to edit, abridge, refuse to post or remove any content submitted by a user to the Forums.                Komen's moderator program is designed to enlist volunteers to assist Komen in these efforts through the designation of one or more moderators for each particular Forum. The role of the moderator is to serve as an on-line watchdog of the particular Forum(s) to which you are assigned.  You are asked to monitor any content and conduct on that particular Forum and to exercise in diligent good faith and in an objective manner the limited administrative privileges granted to you.  In particular, you should look for any content that the average reasonable person would consider to be defamatory, trade libelous, threatening, harassing, invasive of privacy, stalking, harassment, abusive, tortuous conduct, hateful, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex or disability, pornographic, or obscene.  You should look for any content that advertises or solicits a commercial product or service.  You should look for any content that promotes an illegal or criminal act.  You should look for any content that is patently incorrect or inaccurate based on facts generally known to the public.  You should look for any content that falsely impersonates a Komen officer or employee.

Upon your appointment as a moderator to a particular Forum, your on-line account will be set up with limited administrative privileges.  These privileges may be accessed from either your on-line account or the moderator icon appearing at the bottom of the Forum's home page  Your administrative privileges will allow you to do the following:        :   You can remove any content from the post to the recycle bin. Any content in the recycle bin will be deleted (or recovered) by Komen's website administrator. :  You can move any content from one post to another post within the same Forum. If the content of the post is not suitable for that Forum, you can move the content to a post in a different Forum. If you move any content from one post to another post, the subscribers to that Forum will receive a notification. :  You can report any content or complaint posted by a subscriber and/or any on-line conduct of a subscriber to Komen's website administrator for special review.  This privilege should be used when the same content is repeatedly reposted by the same subscriber after you delete it or when the illicit nature of the content warrants further consideration after removal or when the continued conduct of a particular subscriber could chill the participation of (or even cause harm to) the other subscribers of the Forum or when you are uncertain as to how to adequately respond to a complaint.                           Your use of such limited administrative privileges will be subject to oversight by Komen's website administrator.                                Each Forum will have an on-line reporting tool by which its users can report any complaints about any content posted on the particular Forum.  As the moderator, you will be responsible for reviewing and responding to each complaint by selecting the appropriate response from your administrative privileges (or no response if necessary).  Careful consideration should be given to each complaint and the appropriate administrative privilege to use to address the complaint.  However, at no time should you directly email or contact to a subscriber about a complaint. Each Forum also will have an on-line reporting tool by which any subscribers can report a problem with the moderator of the particular Forum to Komen's website administrator.  The list of moderators can be accessed by using the \u201cMember list \u2013> User Groups\u201d Menu on the home page of the Forums.  Moderators will be denoted as a separate group.

My name is Melissa.  I have two \"spots\" / right breast.          Now I have the \"spots\".         I'm 45, married for 3 short years to a man who does not understand the severity of the \"spots\".  I have a grown daughter who'd \"rather not talk about it\" and a 17 year old son who I'd rather not worry.         So I have come here.  Because I am alone and I don't need to be right now.         Unfortunately for me, I have no insurance.  It's funny, I've always been insured my whole life.  I lost my job last June, lost my insurance shortly thereafter and then BAM!  I got the \"spots\".         I thought I could sign up for medicaid but I don't qualify.  The state people tell me that I either have to be over 65 or have dependent children living in the home to qualify.  There are no programs for 45 yr olds.  I'm in between children at home and old age.         They recommended I call The American Breast Cancer Society.  They told me they were out of funding.  Maybe in August they may get more and I filled out the application just in case.         My last mammogram was 10/9/09 when they found the \"spots\".  I was supposed to go for a followup mammo.  Well, that was 8 months ago.  Time is ticking.  I can actually feel it.         So....I don't think I'll survive.  Without medical care there is virtually no hope.  I have decided to spend what's left of my life education others and fighting for funding for this site as well as other programs that help women like me.         The in-betweeners.         You see the pink t-shirts, pink pens, ribbons and bracelets.  You hear of walks and fundraisers and promotions.         But you never think your very life would someday depend on the funding these programs bring.         And then you find out that there's no more money left to help you and you wonder, how many of us \"in-betweeners\" are there?           So I've decided to join this group and start my own topic.

I am a graduate from Texas Tech School of Allied Health Sciences with Honors. Despite being a male with no immediate family with breast cancer, I have a big heart for breast cancer patients.         In 2013, I decided to dedicate all I got to educate, create awareness, screen, faciliate treatment and in situations where nothing can be done, assist to make death pain free and with dignity. It has been an uphill battle due to many reasons like finances, lack of trained and skilled healthcare workers in Kenya, lack of technology (radiotherapy), lack of policy support and overwhelming requests that I can't meet. It's heart breaking.         March this year, I decided to cash out my 401K to afford used mammogram machines in USA. God is great because I was able to afford 3 machines. Currently, there are only 12 machines in a population of 22.5 million women. My goal is to double this number in 3 years. It's going to happen!         Together with my wife, we've been working to save money to get these machines installed to start screening. I thank God that as a nurse, I will not only be able to re-build another retirement plan but also save something to enable us to start screening and early detection. I am nothing but greatful for America because if it were not for being in USA, this would not have started.         We have started a website we called \"Cancer Free Women\" at . Our goal is to save even if it only one life. Women are the most important units of livelihood in Africa. Without the mother, it is almost always the case that children end up on the streets, uneducated and in most cases, die before adulthood. We HAVE TO support women, even if our efforts will save only one live. It is well worth it!         Mountains to climb ahead:         Currently, Kenya has only 6 registered oncologists, 4 radiation oncologists, 4 radiotherapy machines and 3 registered oncology nurses. Cost of cancer treatment is prohibitive. Cancer treatment in Kenya is poor with 80% mortality rate. With World Health organization (WHO) estimated 82,000 new cases per year, there is no way the available personnel or equipments are delivering evidence based cancer care. Currently, over 80% of breast cancer diagnosed cases are stage 3 & 4, meaning, patients took themselves to the hospital. Breast cancer screening does not exist         We would like to invite anyone to join us at any capacity. From just prayers, taking a mission trip to Kenya to create awareness and education to donating medical equipment. Anything and everything is helpful.

Many have been members for years, others (like me) have joined within the last 12 months. There is a Newcomer's Forum where you can \"Tell Us Your Story.\" You don't have to post much. Just tell us that you are new to the community, what your diagnosis is, and where you are in your fight against this disease. We promise that one of the moderators and many of our more active members will give you a warm welcome. We welcome you here, while at the same time are sad that you have received a diagnosis that provides you entry into the \"survivor's club.\"        We ask that all new comers please post a little information (as much as you're comfortable with) in your Signature field (found under ). The signature is used to display your diagnosis or co-survivor history and any other tidbits about you that you would like others to know.      Note: We consider someone to be a survivor from the minute they are given a diagnosis of cancer and didn't drop dead from shock! So whether you were diagnosed today or 20+ years ago, you are a SURVIVOR and a WARRIOR.", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=280616"], "subject": "Welcome"}

I am a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, a photographer, a spiritual being and I have breast cancer at forty years old.   I was diagnosed with DCIS, stage zero on June 21, 2011 and am scheduled to remove both breasts on July 27, 2011 with reconstructive surgery. I am one of the lucky ones as I found it and had time to make a decision on my treatment. My mother is a breast cancer survivor and six years ago when she found hers I started my annual mammograms.  Because I had six years of mammograms to compare against, they were able to immediately target an area that looked suspicious.  One biopsy later I was added to the list of women who was diagnosed that day.   I believe that \u201cthings\u201d happen for a reason and that in every challenge, there is a lesson. I truly believe that my lesson in this journey is to \u201clet the walls down and let the love in!\u201d I have always been the one to take care of others, helping them up and giving them my full support. Now it is my turn to learn to let others help me. I have always been outspoken and open to advise, even taking it at times, but never have I \u201clet people love me.\u201d Too many old wounds, so I\u2019ve always had the walls up to protect me. I never thought that people would want to help, never needed help, until now. This lesson is a hard one to learn but I\u2019m slowly allowing myself to \u201clet the love in\u201d and my friends and family have been there and not let me down. I am naturally a positive person and although I\u2019m a realist, I\u2019m optimistic about life in general. I have chosen to take a stand and tell people about my journey in hopes that I can inspire others, both men and women. I have no idea how my story could help people down the road, if not today, but I know it can\u2019t hurt.   As part of my journey, I had a shirt made up and on the front it says \u201cTHESE don\u2019t define me and neither does breast cancer!\u201d The back reads \u201cI am in the process of becoming a breast cancer survivor!\u201d This is how I feel and I can\u2019t wait to mark out most of the words so it will read, \u201cI am a breast cancer survivor!\u201d My friends suggested to have shirts made up that read, \u201cMy friend is in the process of becoming a breast cancer survivor!\u201d so I did for $25. Now they are not only supporting me by warring them, they are bringing awareness to the cause and others are taking notice. I have people who have seen my friends warring the shirts give them their information for me in hopes of obtaining a shirt as well. Part of the money is going toward my medical bills and boy does that help!   Being a photographer, I felt a very strong urge to document my journey. I wanted a very POWERFUL image to convey the emotional side of how I was feeling but the impact of being a forty-year old having breast cancer as well. With the help of one of my very good friends, I was able to capture that image in the black and white photo that is titled, \u201cThese do not define me!\u201d I knew that I would never forgive myself if I did not have that very special \u201cphoto session\u201d and I will never forget it either. I hope that I will be able to offer other women that experience and capture that powerful yet beautiful moment in life as I grow my photography business. I believe that this too, is one of the lessons I\u2019m being taught so that I can be there for others in time.   In closing, I would like to welcome you to travel down this path with me and hear how I may have inspired you.

Breast cancer treatment and fertility A main concern for young women being treated for breast cancer is loss of fertility. Both chemotherapy and tamoxifen can damage the ovaries, causing irregular periods or stopping periods altogether.     With tamoxifen, regular periods should return after treatment ends. However, even in women whose periods return, treatment can shorten the window of time to have children. Because of the danger of birth defects, women should not become pregnant while taking tamoxifen (generally given for five years) []. Over this treatment time, natural fertility may have begun to decline.     With chemotherapy, it is more likely the loss of periods will be permanent. (Certain chemotherapy combinations are less likely to cause permanent menopause than others.) Women younger than 40 at the time of treatment are more likely than older women to have their periods return after chemotherapy. The risk of permanent menopause slowly increases with age.     Both tamoxifen and chemotherapy tend to bring on natural menopause three to five years earlier than normal []. This further limits time for pregnancy and childbirth.   Preserving fertility during breast cancer treatment Storing embryos There are steps you can take before treatment begins to help preserve your childbearing options. Storing embryos before treatment is one option. In this procedure, eggs are collected over a number of menstrual cycles, fertilized and frozen. After treatment, the embryos can be thawed and implanted into the uterus.     This procedure has a good rate of success, but it also has some down sides. Treatment may be delayed while eggs are collected, and a sperm donor is needed to fertilize the eggs before they are stored [].     Unfertilized eggs (which do not require a sperm donor) can also be frozen and stored. However, this method is much less likely to result in pregnancy compared to storing fertilized eggs and is still considered experimental [].     Protecting the ovaries during treatment Chemotherapy attacks fast-growing cells. These include not only cancer cells but also cells in other parts of the body, like the ovaries. Drugs like goserelin (Zoladex), leuprolide (Lupron) and triptorelin can shut down the ovaries during chemotherapy, which may protect them from damage and lower the chances of early menopause [].     More studies are needed to know if these drugs truly protect the ovaries and speed a return to regular periods. It is also unclear if these drugs affect prognosis.   Talking with a fertility specialist If you wish to have a child after treatment, talk to your health care provider (and if possible, a fertility specialist) before making treatment decisions and discuss your options. Meeting with a fertility specialist as early as possible (before surgery) offers the widest range of options.   Clinical trials for fertility preservation Research is ongoing to improve fertility preservation. New methods are being studied in clinical trials. After discussing the benefits and risks with your health care provider (and if possible, a fertility specialist), you may want to consider joining a clinical trial on fertility preservation.   in collaboration with Susan G.

Fewer than five percent of all breast cancers diagnosed in the U.S. occur in women under 40. Even so, if you are a woman in your 20s or 30s, you may worry about your risk of breast cancer now and in the future.     This overview covers breast cancer basics for younger women, including risk, risk factors and screening recommendations. It also provides a summary of breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and survivorship issues for younger women.      In general, the risk of breast cancer is low for younger women. For women 40 or younger, the chance of developing breast cancer over the next 10 years is less than two percent.     However, the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Over a lifetime (up to age 85), women in the U.S. have a 12 percent (1 in 8) chance of developing breast cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Source: American Cancer Society                                     Most factors that increase breast cancer risk in older women (such as drinking alcohol) also increase risk in younger women. And, most factors that lower risk in older women (such as ever having breastfed) also lower risk in younger women.     We don\u2019t know what causes breast cancer to develop in any one woman, no matter her age. However, a few factors are especially important to breast cancer risk in younger women. These include inherited gene mutations and African American ethnicity.    Learn more about .     Certain genetic factors put younger women at an increased risk of breast cancer.  and  (BReast CAncer 1 and 2) are the best-known genes related to breast cancer risk. Women who have an inherited mutation in one of these genes have an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancers.     Breast cancers related to  and  mutations tend to develop at a younger age than other breast cancers. For this reason, younger women diagnosed with breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing for  and  mutations. However, it is important to remember that most breast cancers, even among younger women, are not caused by gene mutations.    Learn more about .      Learn more about .      After menopause, white women have higher rates of breast cancer than African American women. However, before menopause, African American women have higher rates of breast cancer. This may be due, in part, to differences in some reproductive factors that increase breast cancer risk. For example, African American women tend to start their periods at younger ages than white women.     The biology of breast tumors in younger African American women may also be different from the biology of breast tumors in other women. For example, younger African American women are more likely than older African American women or women of other ethnicities to be diagnosed with .

Screening mammograms are not recommended for women younger than 40 who are at average risk of breast cancer. For most women ages 20 to 39,  at least every three years is recommended.     However, for younger women at a higher risk of breast cancer (such as women with a  or  gene mutation) more intensive screening may be recommended. These women may begin mammography at an earlier age and they may need breast MRI in addition to mammography and clinical breast exams.     Because most young women do not get mammograms, breast cancer is most often first detected when a woman notices a lump or change in the look or feel of her breast, nipple or underarm area. A health care provider may also note a change during a clinical breast exam.    Although most changes in a young woman\u2019s breast are not breast cancer, any change should be reported to a health care provider.     Learn more about .    Learn about the .     Younger women are more likely than older women to have more advanced stage cancers at diagnosis. They tend to be diagnosed with breast cancers that are:     Only  (ER-positive) breast cancers can be treated with hormone therapy. Since ER-negative cancers lack estrogen receptors, they do not benefit from hormone therapy. This means there are fewer treatment options for ER-negative breast cancers. ER-negative breast cancers also tend to  (come back) earlier than ER-positive cancers.     Breast cancer treatment for younger women is often effective and survival is usually good. With treatment, most young women can expect to live many years.     However,  tends to be worse for women under 40 than for older women because breast cancers that occur in younger women tend to be more aggressive. Prognosis may also be worse if there are delays in diagnosis.      Delays in diagnosis can lead to breast cancers being diagnosed at a later stage, when chances of survival are lower. The good news is that today most younger women do not have a delayed diagnosis of breast cancer. They see their health care providers shortly after they notice symptoms and are usually diagnosed within a month. However, some younger women with low income or a lack of insurance may be more likely than other younger women to delay seeking medical help when they notice symptoms.      Age itself does not greatly affect breast cancer treatment options. However, a woman\u2019s menopausal status does affect some treatment options. For example, ovarian suppression is a hormone therapy that can only be used to treat women before menopause. And, aromatase inhibitors are hormone therapy drugs that can only be used after menopause. Most non-hormonal breast cancer treatments (such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy) do not depend on whether or not a woman has entered menopause.    Learn more about  .

Starting down the path of survivorship at a young age can be especially hard. At a time in life most often reserved for family and career, issues of treatment, recovery and survivorship suddenly take top priority.    Breast cancer impacts a woman\u2019s  and emotional well-being, as well as her physical health. Concerns about body image and sexuality are common. Moreover, early menopause can cause changes that decrease sexual pleasure.     These unique concerns can make younger survivors feel isolated. Because most women with breast cancer are older, it\u2019s easy to feel alone even among other survivors. A support group tailored to younger women with any type of cancer may be more helpful than one for breast cancer survivors (where most members may be older). Younger women need to be able to share their thoughts and feelings with women who are at the same stage of life and are juggling similar priorities, such as raising a family and working. Some websites, such as the , offer chat rooms and e-mail discussion groups for young survivors.      A main concern for some younger women being treated for breast cancer is loss of fertility. Chemotherapy can damage the ovaries and both chemotherapy and the hormone therapy drug tamoxifen can cause irregular periods or stop periods altogether, leading to early menopause. With tamoxifen, regular periods usually return after treatment ends. However, tamoxifen is taken for many years and over this time, natural fertility may decline. With chemotherapy, the loss of periods may be permanent.     There are things younger women can do to help preserve their childbearing options.

According to Ann Partridge, MD, MPH, Komen Scholar and Clinical Director of the Breast Oncology Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, \"When young women are diagnosed with breast cancer, they often are challenged by major medical and emotional issues.  An increasing focus on the issues that are either unique to young women (e.g., fertility, diagnosis during pregnancy) or accentuated by their young age (e.g., beauty and body image concerns, psychosocial distress, genetic risks) has helped young women to have additional information, resources and support in order to get not only get through their diagnosis and treatment, but thrive long thereafter.\"     In women under 40, breast cancer is not common, but it does occur. Although we don\u2019t know all the risk factors for breast cancer in younger women, having a  or  gene mutation greatly increases risk. Younger African American women also appear to have an increased risk compared to older African American women and younger women of other ethnicities.     Breast cancers that develop in younger women tend to be more aggressive than those in older women. However, with treatment, prognosis tends to be good and most younger breast cancer survivors go on to live full lives.    While a breast cancer diagnosis is a shock for any woman, younger women face special challenges. Treatment can cause early menopause and impact childbearing. For women who want to have a child after treatment, it is best to talk with a fertility specialist before treatment begins to have the widest range of options.     For younger breast cancer survivors, support may be especially important. Because so few younger women are diagnosed, it\u2019s natural to feel alone. Although there are few support groups specific to younger women with breast cancer, there are support groups for younger women with any type of cancer. Online and phone sources of support are also available.                                                                                                                                         Since 1982, Komen has invested more than $8.5 million in grants to support research related to breast cancer in young women. These grants have support clinical trials as well as studies that address early onset breast cancer in disparate populations.

About three years ago I started going to the Stephanie Speilman center in Columbus for the 4-D Mammos which has helped to cut-down on the call-backs significantly.  My most recent mammo was last May and all was well.  No call back.  Well, last January I suffered my first \"seizure - like episode\" and have battling an unknown condition for about a year.  In that year I have lost some of my reflexes and sensory on my left side, some of my cognition and memory is starting to slip, I am have a hard time with balance and mood swings that tends to come and go and my vision in my left eye is getting worse.  I have been through several clinics in Cleveland for this condition and they all agree there is something, but they can't find the single one cause, just a lot of signs and symptoms of a lot of things.

If this wish isn't fulfilled then I wish that early detection prevails.       Over the past years since my diagnosis I've listened to people and it still surprises me the number who have the \"it won't happen to me\" attitude.  I've heard that during our fundraising event in October. At the same time, I've heard from people who purchased baked goods from us how glad they were that we were raising money as they have known women who have died from breast cancer.  My sister confronted one of my niece's friends over a rant she posted on facebook.  The rant had to do with the fact that October is so focused on breasts that everywhere she turned she saw pink ribbons and ads about boobs.  She didn't know anyone that this affected and no one in her family had it so she just didn't want to hear about it.  She would rather see money go to her church where it would do some good.  My sister explained that yes she did know someone affected by this disease. She knew me.       When I look at the faces of my niece's children (ages 6, 4, 3 & 2), it concerns me as to what the future holds.  I pray that cancer (regardless of type) is not part of their vocabulary other than reference to something in the past.  If that is not the case, then I pray that a cure is available instead of just a treatment.       Have a safe, healthy and happy new year.

I recently produced a DVD exclusively for breast cancer battlers and survivors called \u201cYoga for Breast Cancer\u201d, and a beginner video called \"Healing Yoga for Cancer\".        My journey in creating these DVD's came from a personal search for a yoga DVD for my mother, who had survived 22 years of active and metastastized breast cancer.  As more and more women are living and surviving this disease, there is also an emotional and physical toll that is exacted on their bodies and psyches.  My goal was to help alleviate some aches and pains, speed healing and recovery, and provide calmness of mind and spirit.  While I had read about studies extolling the virtues of yoga in healing breast cancer, I couldn\u2019t find any videos tailored to fighting breast cancer specifically.  And from this inspiration, \u201cYoga for Breast Cancer\u201d was born!  To learn more about my mother, Priscilla, and her journey, please visit       Along with an amazing instructor, Denise Hopkins, Thriving Yoga has created two fantastic videos, one of the first of their kind, utilizing breath, asanas, and guided meditation to create a healing and powerful practice that can be done at any time, in the convenience and privacy of home.  However, our newest challenge is getting the word out!  As a labor of love, our video doesn\u2019t have a marketing budget so we are relying on the survivor and cancer network to get the word out.  We have pledged that 50% of all our videos produced are donated to cancer centers, survivor groups and hospitals in an effort to touch as many lives as possible.         I hope that you may find these videos healing and helpful, they can also be viewed on youtube for free.  Please reach out to us at  if you have any donation requests or comments.

I noticed redness, warmth, swelling on my left breast about 2 months ago, but assumed it was just a side effect of pregnancy.  Finally, went to my GP, who dx as cellulitis and prescribed antibiotics.  The antibiotics had no effect.  I then went to a dermatologist who told me that he did not think it was cellulitis and wasn't sure what it was, but likely just hormones due to pregnancy.  At that time, I hadn't researched much on my own, but something still didn't feel quite right to just wait and see.  My OBGYN suggested that I see an breast specialist right away.  I saw him on Friday and he immediately ordered an ultrasound that day.  I had an ultrasound which did reveal skin thickening and enlarged lymph nodes on the left side.  They then did a mammogram (double shielded) which just showed the enlarged lymph, nothing else.  They then decided to do a core needle biopsy on the node.  So now, I'm just waiting.  Based on everything I've read, even if the core biopsy comes back negative, I'm going to ask for a punch biopsy on the actual rash, since IBC seems so difficult to diagnose sometimes.  Unfortunately, I've also read stories where that came back negative the first time, too!  As all of you know all too well, I'm terrified.  This is my first baby -though I was pregnant twice before and had miscarriages. I find it difficult to even think about the baby now, amongst all of this.  I was going to go shopping today for new outfits because I'm not fitting into anything, but I thought I'd better not because it might just be a waste of money.

As I have discussed previously in this column, there is also some research evidence available to suggest that low levels of Vitamin D may, similarly, be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, as well as a possible increase in the risk of recurrence of prior breast cancers (although the results of still other studies have not supported these conclusions).  Now, a new analysis of recent breast cancer prevention research studies suggests that higher levels of Vitamin D in the blood may indeed  decrease the risk of developing breast cancer.          Meta-analysis studies use powerful statistical formulas to combine the results of multiple smaller research studies into a single larger and more conclusive \u201cmeta-study.\u201d  This form of statistical analysis is especially useful for evaluating clinical research studies that have utilized different research methods to arrive at their final conclusions.  A new meta-analysis of 11 previously published breast cancer risk research studies has just been published, and this new comprehensive meta-analysis appears in the current issue of the journal .    Following meta-analysis of the results of 11 different breast cancer risk studies, this new study determined that high-normal levels of Vitamin D in the blood were associated with a significantly lower risk of developing breast cancer when compared to low Vitamin D levels.  Indeed, in this meta-analysis, a Vitamin D level of 47 ng/ml in the blood was associated with a whopping , when compared to women who had very low blood levels of this hormone-like vitamin.  (While there is no uniform agreement on \u201cnormal\u201d blood levels of Vitamin D, most experts recommend that Vitamin D levels be maintained in the 30 to 50 ng/ml range.)         While increased Vitamin D intake has been repeatedly linked with a lower risk of some cancers, as well as a decreased risk of heart disease, excessive Vitamin D levels in the blood can cause serious illnesses, including kidney failure, calcium deposits throughout the body, gastrointestinal ulcers, and other serious health problems.  Therefore, prior to beginning Vitamin D supplementation (or, indeed, before starting any new supplement or medication), please consult with your personal physician first!                                     :", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=336002"], "subject": "Vitamin D May Significantly Decrease Breast Cancer Risk"}

Although it\u2019s easy to tune out the health mantra that almost every person could say in their sleep: \u201cExercise regularly and watch your weight.\u201d  It\u2019s an important message that everyone should take to heart, especially breast cancer survivors. A healthy lifestyle may help boost survival as well as help relieve many conditions survivors often endure such as pain, fatigue, stress and anxiety. Getting regular exercise and avoiding weight gain also has the added benefit of lowering the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke.                       Weighing the Evidence: The Importance of Exercise and Healthy Weight for Breast Cancer Survivors            It\u2019s a health mantra almost every woman could say in her sleep: \u201cExercise regularly and watch your weight.\u201d  In fact, it\u2019s heard so often that it\u2019s very easy to tune out. But, this is an important message that everyone should take to heart, especially breast cancer survivors.         There\u2019s very good evidence that exercising and maintaining a healthy weight is beneficial for breast cancer survivors. A healthy lifestyle may help boost survival as well as help relieve many conditions survivors often have to endure, like pain, fatigue, stress and anxiety. Getting regular exercise and avoiding weight gain also has the added benefit of lowering the risk of other major diseases - like heart disease, diabetes and stroke. These diseases remain important concerns for everyone, including survivors, as they get older.        Does exercise affect survival after breast cancer?      Regular exercise has a positive effect on the health of breast cancer survivors. Not only is it linked to a lower risk of dying from breast cancer (breast cancer-specific mortality), breast cancer survivors who exercise also have a lower risk of dying from any cause (overall mortality).          Find a  .            How much and what type of exercise should I get?       The American Cancer Society (ACS) Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors recommend that breast cancer survivors:         Results from a large study of over 13,000 breast cancer survivors found that women meeting or going beyond the 150 minutes per week guideline had a 25 percent lower risk of dying from breast cancer and a 27 percent lower risk of dying from any cause compared to women who were less active.        The ACS guidelines also recommend adding strength-training exercises twice a week for added benefits (see safety issues below). Whether through lifting weights, using exercise bands or other means, the focus should be a balanced one that works all major muscle groups.         Does exercise affect other aspects of life after breast cancer?       A number of studies have found that exercise can provide a positive boost to many aspects of life as a survivor. Quality of life, physical functioning (being able to do day-to-day activities), energy levels and anxiety levels all improve with regular exercise.4 Exercise may also reduce fatigue, depression and pain as well as help manage post-treatment symptoms. According to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Medical Oncologist and Komen Grantee Dr. Jennifer Ligibel, \u201cMany studies have shown that even modest amounts of exercise after a cancer diagnosis and treatment can help breast cancer survivors feel better, experience fewer side effects from treatment and increase their energy.\u201d              What about safety?       Studies show that exercise is safe during chemotherapy and radiation therapy as well as after treatment. Even for breast cancer survivors with lymphedema, weight-lifting (strength training) in a supervised setting does not appear to worsen the condition and may even help relieve some symptoms. Women with lymphedema who are interested in upper body strength training may want to talk to an exercise specialist to ensure the exercises are done correctly and safely.         Survivors with heart, bone, nerve or extreme fatigue issues should consult with their health care providers before starting a new exercise program. And, it\u2019s important for women to ask their providers how much time they need to allow for healing after breast surgery before doing anything more than light activity.         How does weight affect recurrence and survival after breast cancer?       Being overweight \u2013 especially being obese \u2013 at the time of diagnosis is linked with both poorer overall survival and poorer breast cancer-specific survival. It may also increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence.         Gaining weight after diagnosis has also been shown in some studies to increase the risk of recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality.          Find a  .            What\u2019s a healthy weight for a survivor?      The last thing any breast cancer survivor wants to deal with after going through diagnosis and treatment is added worry about her weight. The most important goal is to try to keep your weight steady and not to gain. If you are overweight and looking to do more, the best way to lose weight is a combination of healthy diet and exercise. Talk to your health care provider about the best approach for you.         Your ideal weight depends upon your height, so recommendations are usually based upon body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure that combines height and weight. A BMI between 18.5 and 25 is considered a healthy weight.  For example, for a woman who is 5\u20196\u201d, this means a weight between 115 to 154 pounds. .            What else can survivors do?       In addition to exercising, there are many other behaviors that are important for the health of breast cancer survivors \u2013 both in terms of cancer and other chronic diseases. For example, breast cancer survivors should follow the same healthy diet recommended for everyone.This diet, outlined below, promotes overall health and may help protect against different types of cancer and other diseases.         Adapted from American Cancer Society\u2019s Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors, Washington University School of Medicine's Siteman Cancer Center\u2019s Your Disease Risk and Institute of Medicine\u2019s Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D.

Being more active and maintaining a healthy weight not only make you feel good inside and out, but also lower your risk of many chronic diseases. For breast cancer survivors, there are added benefits. Exercise and maintaining a healthy weight improve survival and may lower the risk of breast cancer recurrence.         Even if you were not active or were overweight before your diagnosis, you can adopt a healthy lifestyle at any time and still get the many benefits.        What is Komen doing?

Christine tells everyone \u2013 everywhere she goes, whether she knows them or not \u2013 that men can get breast cancer. Why? Because Christine lost her beloved husband, Paul, to the disease, and vowed to advocate for and educate people about male breast cancer for the rest of her life.   I have never forgotten her. She touched me, and continues to inspire me to help Komen promote male breast cancer education and awareness. Komen has had a huge impact on the breast cancer movement, investing more than $2.5 billion for our mission to save lives and end this terrible disease. I believe it\u2019s our job and our passion to remind the world that our vision of a world without breast cancer includes male breast cancer. I feel I owe it to her and her husband \u2013 no, it\u2019s more than that. I  to do what we can to spread the message.    @ThePurpleHoody      It\u2019s a simple message, really: \u201cMen get breast cancer too!\u201d The statistics may be low, but still about one percent of all breast cancer cases in the U.S. occur in men. That means this year alone about 2,360 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in men, and 430 will die. Those are our husbands, fathers, grandfathers, uncles and our friends.   That\u2019s why today, while we celebrate the men in our lives, we also encourage family members to talk to each other about male breast cancer. We encourage doctors to talk to their patients about it. Learn all you can.   Here are some important facts you should know:   - Although some factors have been found to increase the risk of breast cancer in men, most men who are diagnosed have no known  (except for older age). In men, breast cancer occurs most often between ages 65 and 67.   - Breast cancer screening tests such as clinical breast exams and mammograms are not recommended for most men. However, some  (such as those with a BRCA1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation or a strong family history of the disease) may benefit from screening.   If you have concerns about your risk of breast cancer, talk to your doctor.   So what should you be looking for?  The most common sign of breast cancer in men is a painless lump or thickening in the breast or chest area. However, any change in the breast or nipple can be a , and needs to be checked. Don\u2019t ignore it or wait too long to get help because you are embarrassed or worried. Putting off seeing a doctor may result in a delay in diagnosis. Survival is highest when breast cancer is found early.   Read about  for men who are diagnosed with breast cancer.   Because most people think of breast cancer as something that only affects women, men who are diagnosed may feel isolated and alone. A man may likely be the only man with breast cancer at his treatment center, or the only man he knows with breast cancer. Finding sources of social support may help. If you have questions or concerns, call our  at 1-877 GO KOMEN (1-877-465-6636). Or, check out our  to talk to other male breast cancer survivors about the challenges of living with breast cancer.   So, as we approach Father\u2019s Day, if you are lucky enough to get to spend the day with your dad, I encourage you to hug him a little longer, and be sure you tell him you love him, not just today, but every day.

By  AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF    Updated: 11:59 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011   Published: 7:25 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011                                       When Dao Tran 's breast cancer returned after a year in 2006, she faced a harsh chemotherapy regimen.   \"I did not want to receive that poison in my body,\" Tran said, but she had no choice. The chemo made her so sick she could barely move.   In November 2009, when the cancer struck again, she made a choice that changed her quality of life. Tran, who relocated from New York to Austin, signed up at Texas Oncology in Austin for an experimental drug for the aggressive form of breast cancer that she has. It is one of 20 sites testing the drug nationally.   The results of that trial, published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Debra Patt of Austin and colleagues with U.S. Oncology (the parent company of Texas Oncology), indicate that the drug iniparib not only was effective at shrinking tumors, it also extended patients' lives \u2014 nearly five months longer than patients who did not get it. That's an unexpectedly long time for a cancer that kills in 12 months, on average, said Patt, Tran's doctor.   \"This is a devastating disease, but this is something that offers a real light of hope,\" Patt said.   \"I wished I had this drug when I was first diagnosed,\" said Tran, 45, a married mother of a 12-year-old daughter.   Tran has triple-negative metastatic breast cancer, so named because it does not respond to therapies that target two hormones, estrogen and progesterone, or the protein HER2, which is involved in the growth of breast cancer.   About 15 to 20 percent of all breast cancers are triple-negative, an aggressive, deadly form.   About 207,000 women were expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, and nearly 40,000 were expected to die, according to the National Cancer Institute. Most of the deaths are because the cancer metastasized, or spread.   Iniparib works by preventing DNA that has been damaged by chemotherapy from repairing itself, facilitating the death of cancer cells.   In the trial, which recruited women from September 2007 through March 2009, 57 patients were given iniparib along with two chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and carboplatin, and 59 patients received the chemo drugs alone. In the end, 56 percent of the iniparib patients had their tumors disappear completely, shrink by half or remain stable for six months, compared with 34 percent of the chemo-only group.   \"These findings alone would catch one's attention,\" said an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, but the \"improvement in overall survival by nearly five months with iniparib make this an even more compelling story.\"   Karen Peltier , a state employee, is on the drug after fighting breast cancer for three years and is excited about having more energy and feeling better.   Since she started on the drug in August, the size of her tumor has shrunk 40 percent, said her doctor, Darren Kocs of Texas Oncology's Round Rock office.   \"It really is an important time for these women,\" Kocs said.

The IBIS-1 clinical study was designed to investigate the long-term risks and benefits of taking tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer in women at high risk for developing the disease. The IBIS-I study began recruitment in 1992 and enrolled 7,154 pre- and post-menopausal women from the ages of 35 to 70 years at high risk for breast cancer. High risk was primarily due to a family history. They were randomly assigned to receive either tamoxifen 20 mg daily for five years (3,579) or placebo (3,575). Hormone replacement therapy was allowed during the trial and was used by 49.5% in the placebo group, and approximately 35% of women in each group had a hysterectomy.   IBIS-1 study participants have now been followed for an average of 16 years and there have been a total of 601 breast cancers reported. There have been 251 (7.0%) new breast cancers in women who took tamoxifen, and 351 (9.8%) in women who took placebo. This represents a 29% reduction in breast cancer rates among women treated with tamoxifen. The rates of estrogen receptor\u2013positive breast cancer were reduced by 35%, but no effect was seen for estrogen receptor\u2013negative breast cancers.  Larger benefits were seen for women who did not take hormone replacement therapy during the trial: there was a 45% reduction for estrogen receptor\u2013positive breast cancer and a 38% reduction for all breast cancers for women not currently taking hormone replacement.  Endometrial cancer is a known risk to some women taking tamoxifen therapy. Endometrial cancer occurred in 20 women in the placebo group and in 29 in the tamoxifen group. All endometrial cancers occurred during the five year active treatment period and the difference between the groups is not significant. The risk of developing colorectal cancer was lower in women receiving tamoxifen; however there was an increase in the development of non-melanoma skin cancers with a very low risk for mortality.  The number of women opting to take tamoxifen in order to prevent breast cancer remains relatively low. A major reason for this may be fears about developing endometrial cancer and blood clots, which are know to occur in some women taking tamoxifen. The IBIS-1 study confirms that this risk is not increased in pre-menopausal women. Women at high risk of breast cancer based on genetic screening or positive family history should consider speaking with a medical expert in prevention to better understand the risk and options to prevent breast cancer.     - See more at:", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=360598"], "subject": "IBIS-I Trial Confirms Greater Than Fifteen Year Benefit of Tamoxifen to Reduce Risk of BC"}

Neratinib is an investigational, oral medication that targets HER2 as well as HER4 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Twenty to 25 percent of breast cancers overexpress (make too much of) a protein known as HER2. Overexpression of this protein leads to increased growth of cancer cells and a worse breast cancer prognosis. The development of targeted therapy drugs such as Herceptin\u00ae (trastuzumab) that target HER2-positive cells has improved prognosis for women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Neratinib, like Tykerb\u00ae (lapatnib), and Gilotrif\u00ae (afatinib) is a dual inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR kinases.To evaluate neratinib in the treatment of advanced, HER2-positive breast cancer, researchers conducted a phase II clinical trial administering neratinib in combination with the anticancer drug Torisel\u2122 (temsirolimus) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients in this clinical study were heavily pretreated, having failed an average of 3 prior treatment regimens in the metastatic before entering the trial. The interim safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed side effect for the patients who received the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus was diarrhea. Overall approximately 30% of patients receiving the combination achieved at least a partial disappearance of their cancer. The phase II clinical study clearly demonstrates that neratinib has anti-cancer activity in patients with HER2-positve breast cancer. Continued development of neratinib in clinical trials is ongoing to determine its role in the management of breast cancer. Reference: Gajria D, Modi S, Saura C, et al. A phase I/II study of neratinib plus temsirolimus in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer reveals ongoing HER2 pathway dependence in many patients despite several lines of HER2 targeted therapy.

My dr. put me in the hosp. for a week on IV antibiotics, but not much has changed so she sent finally me home with oral antibiotics and is not sure what is going on. Ultrasound showed tiny pocket of fluid which was aspirated but didn't grow a culture. I am still pinkish, swollen, and leaking drops from my nipple.

What happens next \u2013 Follow-up care for breast cancer survivors      The goal of treating  and  breast cancer is to remove the cancer and keep it from coming back (called recurrence or relapse). With modern treatment, rates of survival without recurrence continue to improve. Unfortunately, there is always a chance that breast cancer may return. However most people diagnosed with breast cancer will never have a recurrence. Follow-up medical care helps ensure any recurrence is properly treated.    Understanding more about breast cancer recurrence and what your follow-up care should (and should not) include may help you feel more in control of your health. It may also help you to discuss these topics with your health care provider.     What are recurrence and metastasis? Breast cancer can recur at the original site (called recurrence or local recurrence), as well as spread to other parts of the body (called metastasis or distant recurrence).      What are my chances of breast cancer recurrence? The chance of breast cancer recurrence varies from person to person. It depends on the original diagnosis, the types of treatment given and many other factors. Most recurrences occur within the first 10 years after treatment.    Talk to your health care provider about your chances of recurrence during follow-up visits. He/she will discuss any signs of recurrence and ask you about any symptoms or concerns you may have.     Risk of a new breast cancer Breast cancer survivors have an increased risk of getting a new breast cancer (called a second primary breast cancer) compared to people who have never had breast cancer.Unlike a breast cancer recurrence (a return of the first breast cancer), a second primary tumor is a new cancer unrelated to the first.    Follow-up medical care for breast cancer survivors All breast cancer survivors should see their health care providers on a regular basis. This care consists of the primary care and health screenings that everyone should get. In addition, the goals of follow-up care for survivors include:     Tests included as part of routine follow-up care Health care providers use these tests to check for signs of recurrence:     Follow-up care for survivors also includes:     Find .    How is a recurrence or metastasis found?  Recurrence A breast cancer recurrence is usually found during a mammogram or a physical exam. If a recurrence is found, tests will be done to see if there is also metastasis.      A recurrence is treated in much the same way as the first tumor. As with a first breast cancer, treatment varies from person to person. Learn more about .    Metastasis Metastasis is usually found when symptoms are reported during follow-up office visits. Symptoms may include:     Don't panic if you have symptoms like weight change or bone pain. These are common and usually do not mean the breast cancer has spread. However, any of these symptoms should be discussed with your health care provider.    Based on the symptoms above, tests will be done to check for metastases. The three main tests are:      and other tests for metastases may be done, depending on a person's symptoms and the findings from the three main tests. Learn more about .     Breast cancer most often metastasizes to the bones, lungs, liver or brain. Although it has spread to another part of the body, it is still considered and treated as breast cancer. For example, breast cancer that has spread to the bones is still breast cancer (not bone cancer) and is treated with breast cancer drugs, rather than treatments for a cancer that began in the bones. Learn more about .     Tests not included as part of routine follow-up care For people with no symptoms of metastases, blood and imaging tests (other than mammography) are not a standard part of follow-up care. Using these tests to check for recurrence or early metastases in people without symptoms does not increase survival.After reviewing the scientific evidence, the determined these tests should not be part of routine follow-up care for breast cancer survivors.    In 2012, ASCO identified five ways health care providers could choose procedures more wisely to avoid using tests and treatments that have not been shown to benefit cancer patients (see all five ). Two of the five recommendations were related to follow-up care for breast cancer survivors.    1.         Don't use PET scans, CT scans and bone scans to stage ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or early breast cancer (stage I or stage II) at low risk for metastasis.     2.         Don't use routine blood and imaging tests (other than mammography) for breast cancer survivors with no symptoms of metastasis. These tests include:     ASCO concluded these tests do not improve survival for people without symptoms of metastasis. And, for some people, these tests may cause harm by leading to more invasive tests, unneeded treatment and/or exposure to radiation. The benefits of these tests are limited to breast cancer survivors with metastasis or symptoms of metastasis ().    Support Fear of recurrence Follow-up visits with your provider are a good time to talk about how you're coping emotionally. Many survivors are afraid they still have breast cancer or that it will come back. These fears are normal. For some people, talking to a counselor or joining a support group can be helpful. Your provider may be able to help you find a counselor or support group.    Recurrence If the breast cancer returns, you may have a strong emotional and physical effect. A support group, especially one focused on breast cancer recurrence, may help you address these concerns. Your provider may be able to help you find a support group.

Dr. Julie Gralow, M.D., a Komen Scholar and Director of Breast Medical Oncology at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Washington School of Medicine sums it nicely. \"Once breast cancer treatment ends, it's important to establish a survivorship care plan with your health care team. Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment frequently result in long-lasting effects, impacting both physical and emotional health. Regular follow-up visits can help address long-term effects of treatment, and also detect recurrence. Communication is key \u2013 even in between visits if issues arise. Healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as physical activity and maintaining a healthy body weight have been shown to improve overall health and may also help reduce the risk of recurrence. Take charge of the factors over which you have control!\"         Since 2006, Komen has invested nearly $100 million into nearly 200 research grants that focus on metastasis and recurrence. Examples of some projects include:     In addition, a few grants focus on the fear of recurrence and the effect that these fears have on treatment outcomes as well as quality of life issues related to recurrence and metastasis.

We are the largest non-profit funder of breast cancer research in the world with an active research grant portfolio totaling more than $313 million and supporting research in a broad range of breast cancer topics.      Komen Research Highlights   At a recent event hosted by the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), Komen-supported UCLA scientists shared findings from their Komen funded projects with members of the local Komen Affiliates, breast cancer survivors and advocates. Komen Scholar, Dr. Patricia Ganz, M.D., Director of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control Research at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center facilitated the meeting.      Reducing Stress and Recurrence Risk in Young Survivors   Dr. Ganz is supported by a Komen Scholar grant to study how mindfulness may reduce the risk of recurrence in young breast cancer survivors. Preliminary findings showed significant reductions in cancer-related stress in young survivors who participated in a guided meditation practice. This is important, because there is an increase in young breast cancer survivors who have long lives ahead of them after treatment. Dr. Ganz is now expanding the study to include women with metastatic breast cancer.      Promising Targeted Therapies for Breast Cancer Brain Metastasis   Nori Kasahara, MD, PhD, and Komen fellow, Akihito Inagaki, PhD. shared exciting results from their studies using a novel system that delivers cancer drugs directly to the tumor cells without harming the surrounding tissues.  Clinical trials in brain cancer suggest that Dr. Kasahara\u2019s system could be used to treat breast cancer brain metastasis. With support from a Komen postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. Inagaki is exploring this potential in mice and early results are promising. If successful, this novel strategy could have enormous impact on the treatment of brain metastasis. Dr. Inagaki, a Japanese citizen, gave a touching thank you to Komen for not only funding his research but for making his dream to do breast cancer research in the U.S. a reality.      Understanding BPA Exposure and Breast Cancer Risk   Susan Krum, PhD. is looking at the controversial role of BPA on the development of breast cancer. BPA, a common chemical found in a variety of household products, is thought to act like the female hormone, estrogen. Studies suggest that BPA and similar estrogenic chemicals in the environment may increase the risk of breast cancer.  Dr. Krum\u2019s early studies show that exposure to BPA stimulates breast tumor growth in mice.  Dr. Krum is a recipient of Komen\u2019s Career Catalyst Research Award, a specialized award designed to provide support to early career scientists. This project not only reflects Komen\u2019s commitment to understanding the impact of environmental exposures on breast cancer risk, but also its commitment to ensuring the future of breast cancer research by supporting the careers of promising young scientists. Dr. Krum\u2019s grant is fully supported by a generous donation from the Princess Cruises Community Foundation in partnership with Susan G. Komen.      It is truly an exciting time in breast cancer research as the rapid pace of technology drives discovery and innovation and continues to expand our understanding of the biology of breast cancer. It\u2019s never been more important for the community to understand the potential for breast cancer research to impact the management, care and outcomes of breast cancer. This symposium gave the affiliate audience an opportunity to feel extremely proud of their contribution to Komen\u2019s Research Programs, and the confidence in knowing that 100% of the money they raise goes towards Komen\u2019s mission to save lives and end breast cancer forever.         Working Together: Scientists, Survivors, Affiliate Network and Advocates in Science   Dr. Sandy Finestone, Psy.D, a long-time breast cancer survivor, Komen Advocate Scholar, and member of Komen\u2019s Advocates in Science steering committee explained how vital it is that the scientists, Affiliate network and Advocates in Science work together. We each have an important role to play in making sure that the patient perspective is always part of the process, advancing the science and not only saving lives today, but creating better treatments for the future.   Together, we\u2019re making a difference.", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=357233"], "subject": "Komen News: UCLA Scientists Discuss Komen Research"}

The number of people 65 and older \u2013 ages where cancer is more prevalent \u2013 will double in size by 2030, the report said, creating a 45 percent increase in the number of people developing cancer. Costs for treating cancer care are escalating as well, from $72 billion in 2004 to $125 billion today and projected to be $173 billion by 2020. Cancer incidence will increase, the report said, against a backdrop of a shrinking oncology workforce.       The report recommended improvements to fix shortcomings that add cost and burden to cancer care.  It specifically recommends initiatives to:    \u2022 Ensure that cancer patients are engaged and informed about all of their treatment options at diagnosis and throughout treatment;   \u2022 Develop a trained and coordinated workforce of cancer professionals;   \u2022 Focus on evidence-based care, using information technology to provide better information about the potential benefits of treatments;   \u2022 Focus on quality measurements, and   \u2022 Provide accessible and affordable care for all.

Komen, and Young Survival Coalition (YSC)\u2014today announced they are working together in a groundbreaking collaboration to document the short- and long-term physical and emotional side effects of breast cancer treatments, as part of DSLRF\u2019s [HOW] Study that eventually may lead to prevention strategies for, and causes of, breast cancer.   Known for its innovative approach to research, the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation decided to crowd-source the question of collateral damage of breast cancer treatment, putting out a call to the public in July to gather questions from those who have been treated for the disease. Within 24 hours of that first call to the Foundation\u2019s Army of Women, more than 800 respondents questioned the physiological and psychological impact and the potential life-threatening effects of their breast cancer treatments. Their questions highlight dozens of side effects such as chemo brain, lymphedema, neuropathy, fatigue, depression, loss of sexual appetite \u2014 and the list goes on.\u201cThere are more than 3 million people in the United States living with a history of breast cancer, but the cure comes with a cost,\u201d said Dr. Susan Love, Chief Visionary Officer, Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. \u201cWhether they are people living with metastatic breast cancer, people whose cancer is in remission, or carriers of genetic mutations who choose to undergo prophylactic treatment, the side effects of today\u2019s breast cancer treatments are wide-ranging, often debilitating and generally overlooked by the medical community. The price of being treated for breast cancer, though often effective at keeping the disease at bay and prolonging life, is physical and emotional as well as financial.\u201d   More data needs to be collected to provide the scientific community with the most robust cohort from which to derive and analyze the true cost of the cure. The Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation reached out to Susan G. Komen and Young Survival Coalition to ask for their help.   \u201cWe were pleased to join with Dr. Love to find answers to these critical questions,\u201d said Susan G. Komen\u2019s Founder and Chair, Global Strategy Nancy G. Brinker, a breast cancer survivor. \u201dThe information gathered here can help the medical community better serve breast cancer patients today, and the larger HOW Study will give us information that could identify causes and preventive strategies for this devastating disease.\u201d   \"This powerful collaboration will ensure that the right questions are asked, including those specific to young women and breast cancer,\" said Jennifer Merschdorf, CEO of YSC and a young breast cancer survivor herself. \u201cIt is paramount that young women are well represented in this study since the collateral damage from breast cancer treatment more significantly impacts their personal and professional lives, including their ability to bear children.\u201d   The public call for questions will continue through October and result in the development of an online questionnaire via the Health of Women [HOW] Study. The Health of Women Study is an online cohort launched in October 2012 to track women and men over time to pinpoint risk factors, successful prevention mechanisms and eventually, to help identify the cause of breast cancer. The collateral damage module of the HOW Study is expected to be launched early in 2014.   Questions about collateral damage from breast cancer can be submitted through October to , #questionthecure. Anyone interested in being part of this initiative can register for the Health of Women [HOW] Study () and complete the basic questionnaires on personal health and/or breast cancer diagnoses. When the collateral damage module is complete and online, they will be notified by email.   \u2019s mission is to achieve a future without breast cancer by focusing on prevention and finding the cause. This will be accomplished by democratizing research to include the public\u2019s voice in the process, facilitating research through programs like the Army of Women launched in 2008 as a resource for researchers, and performing research through projects like the innovative Health of Women [HOW] Study, created in 2012 to identify the cause and cost of the disease through an online cohort.

I was diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer in the summer of 2005. I felt the lump while travelling to a sales conference, and within days, my world fell apart like a house of cards!              The breast cancer had already spread to the lymph nodes under my arm, and I was suddenly facing lots of scientific words I had never heard of before. My state of mind was somewhere between confusion and sheer panic, but I knew I wanted to understand as much as I could about my own diagnosis, so I set out trying to educate myself \u2013 as quickly as possible \u2013 on this disease and what it would mean to me.              Google was my closest friend in those early weeks as I typed in various words and hungrily tried to understand the various explanations given. I was like a sponge in my search for information. One site in particular came up time and time again \u2013 the .              There were pages and pages of questions and replies from individuals who had gone through the same thing I was going through. Many of the individuals were longtime survivors which inspired me even further as I faced my own diagnosis. I was a little intimidated to post a question, but eventually I found the courage, and was beyond delighted when I logged on later the same day and found eight replies!              I thanked the members, and even began to reply to people myself, some of whom were newly diagnosed and new to the board as I had been previously. Before I knew it, I had made lots of friends. Our close-knit community offered me wonderful support as I received treatment, and before long we affectionately named our haven \u201cKomenville!\u201d              I spent almost two years in active treatment, and when I look back, I can see that my journey would have been much lonelier and more frightening without the Komen Message Boards and the support I found there. I\u2019ve seen many friends finish their treatment and move on, but sadly, there are always new members who have just been diagnosed, posting questions and looking for help and support.

And in part, this is what can make breast cancer such a frustrating topic to many women.  While there are countless scientific findings, all this work has identified only a handful of risk factors that women can actually control.          Yet, a number of breast cancer risk factors fall into a middle ground\u2013 somewhat under a woman\u2019s control, somewhat not.  Two less well-known factors that fall into this category are radiation exposure from medical imaging tests and working night shifts.  The science behind each of these factors is still developing, but each can have an impact on breast cancer risk.  According to Komen Scholar Dr. Melissa Bondy, Professor of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Baylor College of Medicine and Associate Director for Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences at the Dan L Duncan Cancer Center, \u201cLike some other risk factors, radiation exposure from medical imaging and night shift work are not completely under a woman\u2019s control. However, identifying these risk factors has increased our understanding of breast cancer and may lead to interventions to lessen their impact on risk.\u201d        Medical imaging     Does the radiation from medical imaging tests increase the risk of breast cancer? It\u2019s been known for a long time that large doses of radiation \u2013 such as from an atomic bomb explosion \u2013 can greatly increase the risk of cancer.  Less well understood are the specific risks related to lower amounts of radiation women might encounter in everyday life.  Some medical imaging tests, however, are sources of radiation that have important breast cancer risks.        Do X-rays and mammograms increase risk?     There seems to be no completely risk-free amount [font=\"inherit; font-style: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; vertical-align: baseline\"]of exposure to radiation. However, the most common imaging test women will have throughout their lives \u2013 X-rays \u2013 carry little breast cancer risk at the frequency most women get them. X-rays may be used to find a broken bone, cavities in teeth or early signs of breast cancer (mammography).  Studies looking specifically at mammography have found that the very small risks that come with the low-level radiation exposure from these tests are outweighed by the potential benefits of finding breast cancer at early stages.  One study projected that if one million women were screened with mammography, nearly 19,000 lives could be saved from breast cancer, yet only a little over 21 deaths would be caused from the low-level radiation exposure over time.  And, with doses of radiation from mammography continuing to decline as the technology improves, any risks from this test are likely to become even smaller.[font=\"inherit; font-style: inherit\"]    [font=\"inherit; font-style: inherit\"]      Do computed tomography (CT) scans increase risk?     There is growing evidence that CT scans can increase cancer risk.  CT scans provide detailed images of the body, but to do this they also deliver much greater amounts of radiation than standard X-rays.  Though it can vary depending on the machine and the test, CT scans of the chest can deliver 100 to 500 times the amount of radiation from an average chest X-ray.  In addition, they\u2019re being used more often. The rate of use of CT scans is about five times higher than it was 20 years ago.  The result is that today women are more likely to get higher lifetime radiation doses from these tests.  A report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) projected that 2,800 excess breast cancers are caused each year by medical imaging tests, with the large majority of these linked to CT scans.  The younger women are when exposed to the radiation from CT scans, the greater the lifetime risk of cancer.         Are there ways to lower the risk from imaging tests?     It\u2019s important that every woman get the medical tests that are important for her health. Mammograms save lives and have little, if any, impact on breast cancer risk.         CT scans are also important but are sometimes being ordered for reasons other than medical need.  This is often simply because the scans are so easy to do and provide such clear images. Concerned patients can also request them, looking for reassurance.  Yet, because they\u2019re not risk-free, patients should feel empowered to ask their doctors about other options and together decide if a CT scan is really needed for their current situation. This can be difficult for a patient \u2013 but it is something doctors are used to discussing. The American Society of Clinical Oncology\u2019s  initiative can help with this discussion by providing lists of tests that may or may not be needed for certain situations. Patients should always feel free to seek a second opinion if the situation allows.         CT scans can provide life-saving information, so no woman should endanger her health by refusing a scan simply to lower her exposure to radiation. However, with a few thoughtful questions, it\u2019s possible to help cut down on exposure and avoid excess breast cancer risk.        Learn more about          Night shift work     Does working the night shift increase the risk of breast cancer?     Over the past decade, good evidence has shown that regularly working night shifts over many years raises the risk of breast cancer.  One analysis that combined the results from 13 studies found that long-term night shift workers had a 50 percent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who didn\u2019t work through the night.  Based on such findings, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified night shift work as \u201cprobably carcinogenic.\u201d        Find .       How does working night shifts increase risk?     Although the exact reasons aren\u2019t known, working regularly through the night may increase breast cancer risk by lowering blood levels of melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that helps maintain normal waking and sleeping cycles. It is commonly called \u201cthe sleep hormone.\u201d Melatonin is normally produced at night, but exposure to light at night suppresses melatonin production.  Several studies have found that women with lower melatonin levels may have higher breast cancer risk.          Can anything limit the effects of night shift work on risk?       It\u2019s currently unclear whether women can do anything to limit the effect that working at night may have on their breast cancer risk.  Trying to cut back on night shift hours will likely help, but may not be an option for all workers.  Taking melatonin supplements has been proposed by some as a possible approach, but currently there is no evidence that it would provide any benefit.  One small, short-term study found that melatonin supplements had no effect on certain breast cancer risk markers.8  Larger, longer-term studies are needed, though, before ruling out any benefit for melatonin supplementation.      Summary     There\u2019s good evidence that certain medical imaging tests and long-term night shift work can increase the risk of breast cancer. These factors aren\u2019t often in a woman\u2019s control, yet there are promising steps being taken to help lessen their impact.  Changes in approaches to medical imaging are being developed to limit CT scans to situations where they are truly medically necessary, and technology advances should help reduce the amount of radiation used during such tests.  Further research should also help identify steps that could limit the increased breast cancer risk linked to long-term night shift work \u2013 whether it\u2019s melatonin supplementation, changing work schedules or some other approach entirely.

Currently, three anti-aromatase drugs are approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with breast cancer: Femara\u00ae (letrozole) Arimidex\u00ae (anastrozole), and Aromasin\u00ae (exemestane).3,4,5 Femara and Arimidex are nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors that bind reversibly to aromatase. Aromasin is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor that binds permanently to aromatase.\u3000  Although aromatase inhibitors such as Aromasin\u00ae provide breast cancer benefits, these drugs have also been reported to adversely affect bone; the use of Aromasin\u00ae by healthy postmenopausal women increases bone loss and joint pain is a well documented complaint of many women.   In the current study published online researchers at Yale School of Public Health in New Haven performed a clinical study that assigned breast cancer patients receiving an AI who reported joint pain to begin an exercise program or engage in usual activity. The exercise program consisted of 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise and twice-weekly supervised strength training.  The researchers found that \"worst joint pain scores\" decreased by 29% in the exercise group and actually increased in the usual-care group. The researchers reported that \"exercise led to improvement in AI-induced arthralgia in previously inactive breast cancer survivors.\" This study offers a solution to the many women requiring treatment with an AI suffering from joint plan and offers them a way forward to continue therapy and enjoy better health through moderate exercise. - See more at:", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=360593"], "subject": "Exercise Significantly Reduces Joint Pain Caused by Hormone Therapy Taken by Patients With"}

The cancer immunotherapy strategy known as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has generated great excitement for its ability to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer. PD-1 is a protein that inhibits certain types of immune responses. Drugs that block PD-1 are called checkpoint inhibitors and may enhance the ability of the immune system to fight cancer. Keytruda is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high-affinity to the PD-1 receptor.   Clinical evidence to date in other cancers is impressive and suggests that Keytruda\u00ae and other checkpoint inhibitors such nivolumab, and Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) are very effective in melanoma, lymphoma and lung cancer.1-4  Breast cancers display different characteristics that require different types of treatment. The majority of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive, meaning that the cancer cells are stimulated to grow from exposure to the female hormones estrogen and/or progesterone. Other breast cancers are referred to as HER2-positive, which means that they overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a biologic pathway that is involved in replication and growth of a cell. HER2-positive breast cancers account for approximately 25% of breast cancers and are treated with agents that target the receptor to slow growth and replication.  Breast cancers that are not stimulated to grow from exposure to estrogen or progesterone and are HER2-negative are called triple-negative breast cancers. Triple-negative breast cancers tend to be more aggressive than other breast cancers, have fewer treatment options, and were the focus of the current clinical trial.  In this study, 32 patients with recurrent or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer positive for PD-1 were administered Keytruda every 2 weeks until they had either a complete response, partial or stable response, or confirmed disease progression.   Overall, 18.5% of patients responded to treatment with Keytruda. There was one complete response, four partial responses, and seven cases of stable disease.   This clinical trial demonstrates that Keytruda has anti-cancer activity in this hard-to-treat group with advanced triple-negative breast cancer. Investigators are moving forward with phase 2 trials and expect to begin enrollment of patients early in 2015, in the hope that they can improve on the early results. - See more at:", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=360595"], "subject": "Initial Results of PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibitors Evaluated in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer"}

The meta-analysis of these 27 studies found that breast feeding reduced the risks of invasive breast cancers by approximately10%. The research, led by American cancer charities with the Washington University School of Medicine and Mount Sinai Hospital, found that breast feeding not only protected against common types of breast cancer but against the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancer as well.  The study did not determine the optimum duration of breast feeding in order to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer; but according to the study authors, the risks seemed to decrease the longer women continued. Broader uptake of breast feeding and completing up to 12 weeks of breast feeding for each baby can significantly reduce the subsequent risk of breast cancer.  It has long been held that hormonal changes that take place during pregnancy and lactation are responsible for the reduction in breast cancer risk. Women do not usually ovulate while producing milk and this is understood to protect against cancer of the breast and ovaries. Doctors agree that breastfeeding is a powerful strategy to reduce the risk of breast cancer and it is fairly well accepted that breast feeding is healthy for the baby as well. - See more at:", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=360594"], "subject": "Breastfeeding Reduces Risk of Developing Breast Cancer"}

Researchers at Vanderbilt University analyzed the medical records of 1.2 million women treated for early-stage breast cancer at major cancer centers between 1998 and 2011.  The proportion of women with early-stage breast cancer who elected to be treated with mastectomy in the affected breast increased from 34 percent to 38 percent during that period. A much more significant trend however was observed for women opting to receive treatment with a double mastectomy which increased from two percent to 11 percent.  Several clinical studies have documented that breast conserving treatment with lumpectomy plus radiation produces similar outcomes to treatment with mastectomy and the trend had been moving away from mastectomy. This study reveals a reversal of the trend toward breast conservation.   The study was unable to identify the reason for the trend toward double mastectomy, but potential reasons might include improvements in breast reconstructive surgery as well as increased fear and anxiety about experiencing a breast cancer recurrence.  Another reason might be an increased awareness of hereditary breast cancer risk as a result of a BRCA genetic mutation. However, the study did not collect data on the number of women who were BRCA positive or who had a family history of breast cancer.   Although there is no right or wrong decision for women with early stage breast cancer who have a choice between treatment with breast conserving surgery or mastectomy, patients should ensure they are fully informed of the risks and benefits of each approach.

Although the ASCO meeting covers the entire scope of oncology, there are usually major breast cancer findings reported, and this year was no exception.  In fact, two out of the five main presentations mentioned below focused on large breast cancer .   Findings from the ALTTO study, a multinational study, co-led by Komen\u2019s 2013 Brinker Award Winner Dr. Edith A. Perez, were reported for the first time.  The study enrolled over 8,000 women with HER2-positive breast cancer who had recent surgery and were about to start chemotherapy ().  The researchers compared:     Much to the surprise of many, combining trastuzumab with lapatinib was not better than trastuzumab alone in reducing  of breast cancer, and the two-drug combination was significantly more toxic.  (However, the vast majority of the women in the trial did well and there were few breast cancer recurrences overall.)  Because trastuzumab alone has so many fewer side effects than trastuzumab plus lapatinib, it is unlikely that the two-drug combination will ever be used to treat early breast cancer.  But, there still remains a role for lapatinib in the treatment of women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  Clinical trials are also continuing to look at other anti-HER2 drugs for early breast cancer.  Although the results for treatment with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab are excellent, there still are women who face recurrences and we would ultimately like to omit chemotherapy altogether.  With these two challenges in mind, we very much need to develop new and better drugs.      The TEXT and SOFT studies also provided important results.  These studies evaluated the role of ovarian suppression in women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  They compared:    Of note, all women in the study were premenopausal and all received ovarian suppression medication to \u201cturn off\u201d the functioning of their ovaries.  With this medication, these premenopausal women became the equivalent of postmenopausal women, and many had significant side effects.  In addition to the ovarian suppression, women received either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.  Although there was no difference in mortality (death) through five years of follow-up, the investigators found that women who received an aromatase inhibitor were less likely to have a recurrence of breast cancer.  At this point, the interpretation of the trial remains somewhat controversial.  Because the standard treatment approach in the U.S. is tamoxifen alone, many doctors are hesitant to change that standard at this point, largely because the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor is so much more toxic than tamoxifen alone.  Some doctors may opt for this approach in women at particularly high risk of a recurrence, and many others are waiting for the results from an additional analysis of the data that will help tease out the role of ovarian suppression when combined with tamoxifen.  Making the matter more complex, a previous study found that ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen was superior to ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor.  Although that study was smaller than the analysis of TEXT and SOFT, it troubles many doctors when two studies so clearly disagree with one another and leads to greater reluctance to change practice.  Of interest, European doctors may be more inclined to change practice, largely because they have accepted ovarian suppression as a standard treatment for many years. Premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should know that tamoxifen alone still remains reasonable, but now there are other options. In the months and years ahead, the option of ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor may be used more commonly.  For the time being, most U.S. doctors are opting for a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach with the plan that if they start or continue a patient on tamoxifen, they can always make a change in the future.   Many other researchers presented data at the ASCO meeting.  There was new information about several classes of drugs including the PI3 kinase inhibitors and the CDK 4/6 inhibitors.  Although none of these drugs are ready for widespread use, they are undergoing active and rigorous evaluation in clinical trials.  These drugs, as well as many others, provide great hope for the future.  In recent years, the pace of progress seems to have accelerated, and each and every year there seems to be something new that can truly have an impact on the lives of women (and men) with breast cancer.", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=359691"], "subject": "Latest Breast Cancer Research News - American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2014 Mee"}

These findings were recently released online by the journal Cancer.   The goal of radiation therapy in early breast cancer is to kill cancer cells that could otherwise remain after therapy and cause a recurrence. Studies have shown that patients with node-negative Stage I breast cancers who are treated with breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) and receive additional treatment with radiation therapy have improved outcomes. Patients who do not receive radiation after lumpectomy may be more likely to experience cancer recurrence. Based on recent findings, however, some researchers are questioning whether radiation is beneficial for all early breast cancer patients.      Findings suggest that women over age 70 who have Stage I estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer may not benefit from the addition of radiation therapy. According to a Phase III study, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 trial, these older patients might do just as well with lumpectomy and additional therapy with tamoxifen alone, rather than both tamoxifen and radiotherapy.  Researchers recently used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to assess the frequency of radiation therapy in addition to lumpectomy in older early-stage breast cancer patients. Researchers identified just over 40,000 women age 70 or older who underwent lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer between 2000 and 2009. They assessed frequency radiation in addition to surgery among these women.      Among patients treated between 2000 and 2004, 69% received radiation in addition to lumpectomy, and 62% of those treated between 2005 and 2009 received additional radiation. Forms of radiation therapy included external beam, where radiation comes from a machine outside the body and is focused on the cancer, and implant radiation, where sources of radiation are put into or near the area that needs treatment. Use of implant radiation increased from just over 1% of patients between 2000 and 2004 to just over 6% between 2005 and 2009; the use of external radiation declined during this period. Radiotherapy in both forms was delivered less frequently over the course of the study.   The researchers concluded that while data from the CALGB trial indicated that radiation in addition to lumpectomy didn\u2019t contribute to better outcomes for older women with early-stage breast cancer, many of these women continue to receive radiation. And while these researchers have observed a decrease in the amount of women receiving additional radiation, according to their findings, nearly two-thirds of older women continue to receive radiation that may not improve their outcomes over treatment with surgery and tamoxifen alone.   These findings are important for patient care because, when effective, less aggressive treatments can help patients avoid side effects and unnecessary cost. - See more at:", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=360597"], "subject": "Some Older Women with Early-Stage BC May Be Receiving Radiation That Is Unlikely to add"}

During this time, overall breast cancer rates have decreased, but have remained stable since 2004. Breast cancer deaths have decreased by as much as 34 percent and continue to decline [1]. These trends indicate real progress. Unfortunately, improvement has not occurred equally among all populations. Many populations within the U.S. continue to be disproportionately burdened by high incidence (new cases) and mortality rates of breast cancer.   These differences lead to, and are often referred to as disparities. They affect how different communities are impacted by breast cancer incidence, mortality and survival. Understanding these differences is critical to reducing breast cancer disparities.    Disparities do not describe all health differences. Disparities are the result of health differences that may arise from inequities such as intentional or unintentional discrimination and/or social disadvantage. They may include, but are not limited to, health differences among populations according to race/ethnicity, ancestry, cultural factors, socioeconomic status, age, sexual orientation, geography, disability or other characteristics associated with social inequality or discrimination [2].    There are many complex factors that contribute to breast cancer disparities. The most apparent factors are linked to medical care and a lack of health care coverage. However, a person\u2019s health is not just a product of good medical care. Studies show it accounts for only a small percent of disparity related breast cancer deaths. Factors affected by social and racial inequalities such as education, income and the quality of neighborhood environments are thought to play a major role in health disparities [3, 4]. Breast cancer disparities can be affected by:          Even when access to health care services is equal, there are differences in the size, stage and grade of breast cancer for many minority women compared to white women. For example:     While social and biological factors each have their own effects on breast cancer disparities, some social factors may help facilitate or contribute to biological differences or disparities. For example:         Caucasian women have the highest  of breast cancer in the U.S. followed closely by African American/black women. Comparatively, Asian American (Asian/Pacific Islander as a group), Native American (American Indian/Alaska Native) and Hispanic/Latina women have much lower incidence rates (Figure 1).                    However, rates can vary a lot even among individual ethnic or racial subgroups. For example, the racial category of Asian and Pacific Islander includes many smaller ethnic groups that are highly diverse in terms of lifestyles, health care practices, socioeconomic status and other factors that can affect breast cancer rates. In fact, research shows that Asian women do not have uniformly low rates of breast cancer. Filipinas have much higher incidence rates compared with other Asian groups; US-born Asian women have higher incidence rates compared with foreign-born Asian women; and some Pacific Islanders such as Japanese or Hawaiian women have been found to incidence rates higher than Caucasian women [12, 13, 14].     The incidence rates of most diseases are higher among poorer communities. However, the opposite is true of breast cancer. Breast cancer incidence is higher in communities with higher socioeconomic status. This may be because women of higher socioeconomic status get screening mammograms at a higher rate than women of lower socioeconomic status, resulting in more breast cancers being found. Increased incidence could also be due to the differences in risk factors found in women of different education and income levels. For example, compared to women with lower income and education levels, women with higher income and education levels are more likely to:    All of these factors may increase the risk of breast cancer [15, 16, 17].    Lifestyle choices influenced by social and racial inequalities can contribute to breast cancer disparities by affecting a women\u2019s risk of breast cancer. Some risk factors for breast cancer are associated more often with some racial/ethnic groups than others, such as:     Lesbians and bisexual women have a greater risk of breast cancer than other women, but this is not because of their sexual orientation. Rather, it is linked to risk factors for breast cancer that tend to be more common in these women (such as never having children or having them later in life). Lesbians also tend to have higher rates of obesity and alcohol use, both of which can increase breast cancer risk [24, 25].    Having a mutation in the  gene increases a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer. Though this mutation is rare in the general population, it can occur more commonly in some ethnic groups such as Ashkenazi Jews [26]. Genetic testing, counseling and risk lowering options are available for women with a BRCA mutation. However, some women lack the understanding or resources to seek out or receive such care. Many low-income or underinsured women, as well as underserved minorities, do not have easy access to or seek out BRCA testing or genetic counseling. This can put them at higher risk for being diagnosed with late stage cancer and dying from the disease [27, 28].    Breast cancer screening rates are similar among all racial/ethnic groups, ranging from 69 percent-73 percent (Figure 3) [29]. However, large differences exist for screening rates among different socioeconomic classes, as well as other disparate populations, which may contribute to disparities in breast cancer incidence observed in those groups. Getting screened can detect cancer earlier when chances for survival are highest.                     : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Cancer Screening- United States, 2010. January 27, 2012/ 61(03);41-45.      Breast cancer stage at diagnosis varies by racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. These differences are important because stage at diagnosis impacts a woman\u2019s survival. Research shows that women from minority and medically underserved populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced or late-stage breast cancer (has spread beyond the breast). For example:    Women who do not have health insurance are almost four times as likely to be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer compared to women with health insurance [50].        Research has found that socioeconomic factors and certain attitudes or misconceptions about cancer are associated with delayed or incomplete follow-up of an abnormal screening mammogram. Such attitudes are common among low-income, minority and under- or uninsured populations and are thought to contribute to breast cancer disparities [40, 41, 42]. Waiting longer for follow-up care may lead to cancers that have spread beyond the breast and are harder to treat. For example:     Factors such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, cultural beliefs, trust in the medical community or differences in medical care can affect the quality and type of breast cancer treatment a woman receives [51].        Many of the same factors that impact whether a woman gets screened, or how and when she seeks treatment, also impact and contribute to disparities in breast cancer survival.   African American/black women have the highest breast cancer death rates of all racial and ethnic groups and are 41 percent more likely to die of breast cancer than Caucasian women [59]. This disparity is attributed to a number of factors, which include higher rates of early onset, more advanced stage at diagnosis and more aggressive cancer subtypes (TNBC) that occur within this population [60].   Hispanic/Latina, Asian and Native American women have much lower mortality rates than either African Americans/blacks or Caucasian (Figure 4). However, like breast cancer incidence, mortality rates can differ among individual racial or ethnic subgroups. For example, some Pacific Islander women, such as Hawaiian, not only have higher breast cancer mortality rates compared to other Asian subgroups, but also have higher mortality rate than either blacks or Caucasians.        Women with low income and/or education levels are more likely than women with higher income and/or education levels to die from breast cancer [61].   Some studies suggest women in a same sex-relationship may have a higher risk of breast cancer death compared to women in a heterosexual relationship [62].   Women with disabilities have a higher mortality rate than those without a disability. It is not clear whether this disparity is due to differences in treatment choices or because women with disabilities may be more susceptible to treatment-related complications, such as infections and toxicities [58].    The economic impact of breast cancer disparities is considerable. A report from the C-Change (Collaborating to Conquer Cancer) organization and Susan G. Komen\u00ae estimates we can save at least $674 million annually in direct medical costs alone by reducing the disparities in breast cancer access and treatment. This is money spent on the expensive, prolonged therapies that late-stage disease often requires. C-Change estimates at least another $116 million in indirect costs of these disparities in terms of lost wages and productivity [63].     The Affordable Care Act (ACA) (healthcare reform) is increasing access to health care for many Americans. Since September 2012, all new health insurance plans have been required to cover mammography for women over the age of 40 every one to two years. Starting in 2014, ACA will give access to health coverage for many low-income women who do not currently have insurance through the Insurance Marketplaces and expansion of Medicaid eligibility.    Learn more about the      The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s  allows each state to provide breast cancer screening to low-income, uninsured and underinsured women. For women who have an abnormal finding, the program also covers diagnostic testing and if breast cancer is diagnosed, referrals for treatment. Women diagnosed through this program can get treatment through expanded  benefits. (Medicaid is run by each state, so coverage varies state to state).   Learn more about the .   Learn more about .    Breast cancer takes a disproportionate toll on women of color and those of low-income and education. While unknowns persist regarding the causes of breast cancer disparities and the best ways to reduce and eliminate them, there is much that is clear. According to breast cancer disparities researcher and Komen Scholar, Dr. Rena J. Pasick, \u201cA societal commitment to access to high quality care and to appropriate education for all women stands to alleviate much of the excess burden of this disease.  And while more research is needed, it should be based on the recognition that scientific advances can themselves exacerbate disparities in the context of differential availability.\u201d     With 117 Affiliates in local communities and across the globe, Susan G. Komen\u00ae is the most progressive grassroots organization fighting breast cancer today. Each year, Komen Affiliates fund thousands of community-based programs that address barriers and needs related to breast cancer. Through community grant programs, education efforts and partnerships, Komen Affiliates are addressing disparities in risk factors that stem from cultural and language differences and societal inequities related to discrimination, provider bias, patient mistrust, poor patient-provider communication, poor adherence and low quality care. These local programs aim to change behaviors and increase access to early detection and quality treatment for disparate populations.   In 2012 alone, Komen Affiliates funded over 1900 grants totaling more than $92 million to local community organizations. These organizations provided millions of services, including mammograms, diagnostic services, educational programs, support services and treatment assistance, to address needs and barriers related to breast cancer disparities.   Komen has also invested approximately $13 million in large-scale vulnerable community grants and national programs that seek to improve quality of care, enhance care coordination, offer financial assistance to breast cancer patients and address unique barriers to breast care for vulnerable populations.    Public policy continues to be a key area of focus at Komen, with sustained advocacy efforts in state capitals across the U.S. and in Washington, D.C. These efforts are focused on protecting breast cancer screening and treatment services, as well as research funding, to advance breast health and cancer care policy at the federal and state levels. It is critical that all women have access to needed breast cancer screenings, life-saving treatment and quality breast cancer care if we are to work to end breast cancer disparities.   Learn more about  for 2014    Susan G Komen\u00ae has long committed resources and efforts aimed at reducing mortality from breast cancer disparities. Among these efforts, Komen funds hundreds of research grants working to eliminate the burden of breast cancer experienced by all women, including the unequal burden imposed upon women from many minority and medically underserved populations. Since it was founded in 1982, Komen has invested more than $89 million in over 250 research grants that focus on issues related to breast cancer disparities. These grants represent more than 10 percent of Komen\u2019s total research portfolio (over $800 million). More than two-thirds of these grants support clinical trials focused on breast cancer disparities. Komen\u2019s disparities grants also include a dedicated grant mechanism that supports the training of graduate students who are pursuing a research career focused on breast cancer disparities, called the Graduate Training in Disparities Research Grant (GTDR).

These findings were recently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.     Cancer is considered relapsed when disease returns after it has been in remission following treatment, meaning that signs and symptoms have disappeared. Preventing relapse\u2014or achieving relapse-free survival\u2014is of course an important goal of treatment.      Researchers with the British Columbia Cancer Agency recently measured changes in patterns of relapse in breast cancer over the past 30 years. Specifically, they looked at relapse according to estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, or biomarker status.      Patients involved in the study were divided into two groups. Group one had been diagnosed with Stage I, II, or III breast cancer between 1986 and 1992; group two had been diagnosed between mid-2004 and 2008. All patients had a known ER and HER2 status. Patients in group one were matched for comparison with patients in group two according to stage, grade and ER and HER2 status. The researchers assessed rate of relapse according to biomarker status.     Each group contained just over 3,500 women. Patients in group one were matched with comparable patients in group two. Among both groups combined biomarker status was as follows: 70% were ER positive/HER2 negative, 7% were ER positive/HER2 positive, 7% were ER negative/HER2 positive, and 16% were ER negative/HER2 negative.      Overall, patients in group two (those diagnosed between mid-2004 and 2008) had less risk of relapse compared with those in group one (those diagnosed between 1986 and 1992). The risk of relapse was reduced by 50%. Patients in the later-diagnosed group had a lesser risk of relapse if their breast cancer was HER2 positive or ER negative/HER2 negative. Group two also had a lower risk of death compared with group one.      According to these findings, breast cancer patients have begun experiencing increasingly more frequent relapse-free survival over the past 30 years. Patients with all types of breast cancer are experiencing these improved outcomes, but particularly those whose disease is HER2 positive or ER negative/HER2 negative. This information can advanced early breast cancer treatment by helping doctors and patients make treatment decisions and researchers plan clinical trials. - See more at:", "redirURL": ["https://apps.komen.org/forums/fb.ashx?m=360596"], "subject": "Breast Cancer Patients Are Now Living Longer without Relapse"}

In addition, the Zoladex group had higher rates of patients becoming pregnant, patients giving birth, and patients with one or more deliveries (or still pregnant).     HR-negative breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that does not respond to hormonal therapy, treatment that lowers the amount of estrogen in the body or blocks its action. A problem associated with the chemotherapy used to treat HR-negative breast cancer is ovarian failure (loss of function before the age of 40).    In this study conducted with multiple research groups, premenopausal women with early stage HR-negative breast cancer were enrolled and treated with a regimen of cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy. Patients were then randomized to take either additional Zoladex or just chemotherapy alone.    Researchers reported that at two years only 8% of the Zoladex patients encountered ovarian failure as compared to 22% in the chemotherapy-alone group.

Pull up any news article or blog post on breast cancer, and you\u2019ll likely wade into a sea of percentages, decimals, odds and fractions.   Often, these numbers describe \u201crisk.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar term but also one that can have some specific meanings when it comes to cancer. Reviewing some of these meanings can help women better understand breast cancer, its risk factors and their relationship to each. You will also get a chance to test your own breast cancer knowledge along the way.   Note that all of the numbers below refer to risk among women in the U.S.      So what is risk exactly?   At its most basic, risk describes the chance of developing a disease over a certain period of time. Though any timeframe can be used, common periods for breast cancer are lifetime risk, 10-year risk and 20-year risk.   Question#1: Lifetime risk   The lifetime risk of breast cancer in a woman in the U.S. is 1 in 8. This is the same as what percentage? (Check your answer below.)   a. 1%   b. 8%   c. 12%   d. 80%   Lifetime risk describes the chance of developing breast cancer at any point in adulthood, usually up to age 80 or 85. The \u201c1 in 8\u201d lifetime risk refers to an average woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer at some point in her lifetime if she lives to be 80 or 85. One in 8 is the same as a 12 percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (that is 1 divided by 8 = 0.12).   Though lifetime risk can be useful for providing a broad view of a disease\u2019s impact in the population, it can also overstate the breast cancer threat because not every women lives to 80 or 85. In addition, the chance of getting breast cancer is not the same throughout a woman\u2019s life, but increase as she gets older.   Looking at shorter timeframes can provide a better sense of a woman\u2019s actual breast cancer risk. This is especially true for younger women.   Question #2: 10-Year Risk   What are the chances a 40 year-old woman will develop breast cancer by the time she turns 50? (Check your answer below.)   a. 80%   b. 20%   c. 3.5%   d. 1.5%   Just as the names imply, a 10-year risk describes the risk of developing breast cancer over the next 10 years. These risks are of often much smaller than the overall lifetime risk of 12 percent.   For the average 40 year-old woman, the risk of developing breast cancer by the time she reaches age 50 is 1.5 percent (less than two percent) \u2013 and by the time she reaches age 60 is 3.7 percent.1  In comparison, the average 60 year-old woman has a 3.5 percent chance of developing breast cancer by the time she reaches age 70 \u2013 and a 6.9 percent chance by the time she reaches age 80.1     Absolute risks vs. relative risks   Question #3 \u2013 Relative risk   Women who drink alcohol (one to two drinks a day) have a relative risk of breast cancer of 1.2 compared to those who don\u2019t drink. This means their risk is increased by what percent? (Check your answer below.)   a. 20%   b. 12%   c. 1.2%   d. 0.2% (less than 1%)   The terms \u201cabsolute risk\u201d and \u201crelative risk\u201d often appear in news stories and magazine articles on cancer. Although they sound similar, it is important to understand the difference between the two.   Absolute risk counts how many people in a group develop a certain disease over a certain period of time, similar to the lifetime and 10-year risks we described above.   Relative risk, on the other hand, shows risk compared to (relative to) something else. It is most often used to describe the impact that risk factors (like family history, weight and exercise) have on cancer risk. A relative risk shows how much higher, how much lower, or whether there is no difference in breast cancer risk in women with a certain characteristic compared to the risk in women without it.   For example, a relative risk of breast cancer of 1.2 for drinking alcohol (one to two drinks per day) means that compared to women who do not drink, those who have one to two drinks per day have a 20 percent greater risk of the disease.   For a full picture, though, it is important to look at both the absolute and relative risks.   For example, in women ages 20 to 35, there are about 4,200 breast cancers diagnosed each year. So, a risk factor with a relative risk of 1.2 would lead to 840 extra cases of cancer.   In women ages 55 to 64 however, there are about 59,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year. So, a 20 percent increase would lead to 11,800 extra cases of breast cancer. While the relative risk is the same, in older women it leads to a much higher absolute risk of disease - more than ten times the number of extra cases.      What is my personal risk of breast cancer?   Despite the number of websites that offer breast cancer risk calculators, they cannot tell you whether or not you will get breast cancer. Why? Because science is much better at predicting what is going to happen in a group of women than what is going to happen to an individual woman.   Research is based on probabilities. Studies look at groups of women and use this information to estimate what might happen to a similar group of women in the future. While these predictions can be very accurate when estimating what percentage of women in a group will develop breast cancer, they\u2019re less reliable at determining which specific women in that group will get cancer.   Even with these limits, however, it\u2019s important for women to have an idea of their personal breast cancer risk. Women at very high risk because of family history or BRCA1/2 gene mutations can take important steps to lower their risk of developing breast cancer. And, all women should choose healthy lifestyle behaviors that may lower their risk of breast cancer and other health conditions.      Summary   Understanding some basic concepts about risk can help put breast cancer into perspective for women of all ages. While lifetime risk can provide a good overview, shorter 10-year and 20-year absolute risks can provide women with a more practical understanding of their breast cancer risk in the near future.   Relative risks are useful for looking at the potential impact of individual factors (such as alcohol) on breast cancer. However, the real impact of a relative risk can be very different, depending on the absolute risk. When breast cancer (or another health condition) is rare, a relative risk has little impact on the number of cases, but when it is common, the impact is much greater.

My aunt was diagnosed two weeks ago and she started chemo on Monday. Surprisingly, she seems like she's ok. Since my aunt and her siblings come from south central Los Angeles, they really do not have the education about breast cancer. They do not seek help from others either. I am in a situation where I know I am going to help my aunt, with anything and everything she needs but I also want to gain the support from the community. I also want to raise money for breast cancer. I have not talked to my aunt about this and I feel like she is going to reject this idea. I signed up for a breast cancer walk with the American Cancer Society on August 18th in Downtown Los Angeles and am trying to get people to sign up for my team and get donations and it is so difficult. I don't seem to be getting the support from my \"friends\" on facebook and even my family is telling me they don't have money.

So it was no surprise that last May she was yet again front-page news.  This time, though, it was not for her latest blockbuster movie or her relief work.  It was much more personal - her choice to have preventive surgery to remove both of her breasts.     Ms. Jolie has a very high risk of breast cancer due to an inherited gene mutation.  For her and other such women, this surgery \u2013 called prophylactic mastectomy \u2013 can greatly reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.  It is one of a number of ways women like Ms. Jolie who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer, but have a very high risk may choose to manage this risk.  Deciding which approach is best is a very personal choice.         Most women are  at high risk for breast cancer.      However, having certain inherited gene mutations can greatly increase the risk of breast cancer. The most common and most well recognized are mutations in the and  genes (BReast CAncer genes 1 and 2). mutations also increase the risk of ovarian cancer.         Less than one percent of the general population in the U.S. has a  mutation.  And, only about five to 10 percent of all breast cancers diagnosed in the U.S. are linked to inherited gene mutations or a strong family history of breast cancer.          Women, such as Ms. Jolie, with a  mutation have a 50 to 70 percent chance of developing breast cancer by age 70.  Women with a  mutation have a 40 to 60 percent chance. In comparison, an average woman has about an eight percent chance of developing breast cancer by age 70. (An average woman\u2019s lifetime risk up to age 85 is 12 percent).         It is important to remember that having a  mutation does not guarantee a woman will develop breast (or ovarian) cancer.  Many women with these mutations will never have cancer.        Women at a very high risk of breast cancer have a number of options to manage their risk.  For example, they can get breast cancer screening more often and starting at a younger age, to find cancer early if it does develop.  Also, there are risk-lowering medications women can take, like tamoxifen and raloxifene.  And, finally there is preventive surgery to remove both breasts (bilateral prophylactic mastectomy) and possibly the ovaries (prophylactic oophorectomy).  Some women may even choose a combination of these options.       Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is the surgical removal of both breasts to prevent breast cancer.  If a woman chooses, the breasts can be reconstructed either during the surgery or sometime after.  To provide better cosmetic results, methods can often be used that save the nipple and spare much of the skin of the breast. Women should talk with a plastic surgeon to discuss their reconstructive options, including the pros and cons of each.       Of all the options for managing breast cancer for women at very high risk, prophylactic mastectomy is the most effective at lowering risk.  Studies show that it lowers risk by 90 percent or more. Risk does not completely drop to zero because a small amount of breast tissue will always remain after surgery.  In premenopausal women, removing the ovaries can further reduce risk of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer.(Removing the ovaries impacts fertility, so for women at very high risk, this surgery is only recommended after women are sure they are finished having children.) Women should discuss the benefits and drawbacks of these surgeries with their physician.       The most obvious benefit of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is the drastic reduction in the risk of breast cancer. Most women report being satisfied with the decision to have the surgery.       Prophylactic mastectomy has many of the same short-term risks as other surgeries.   There is always some danger with any type of general anesthesia.  Pain and infection are also possibilities. Certain risks, though, are unique to mastectomy.  Even with reconstruction, the physical changes to a woman\u2019s body can have an emotional impact. Some women report being unhappy with the look of their reconstructed breasts, suffering from poor body image and feeling some level of loss of femininity or attractiveness.  The loss of physical sensations in the breasts can also change sexual experiences. Support groups, mental health care providers (including sex therapists) and counselors can help women cope with the changes in their bodies and the feelings that come with these changes. Open communication with a partner is also important.     As a reminder, for anyone who has breast cancer related questions or concerns, Komen can help (see below).       In addition to preventive surgery, women can choose other options to manage or lower their breast cancer risk. These include:          Women at very high risk of breast cancer begin getting mammograms and other screening tests earlier and more often than women at average risk.  This more vigilant approach is designed to find any breast cancer that does develop early, so that it can be treated more effectively. This approach, however, does not lower the risk of getting breast cancer. Rather, screening tries to find breast cancer as early as possible.         Breast cancer screening for women at very high risk due to a  mutation includes  ,   and for those over 25,  .          Tamoxifen and raloxifene are the two drugs FDA-approved for lowering breast cancer risk in women at high risk. These medications lower the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk by about 50 percent.          Few studies have directly looked at the use of tamoxifen or raloxifene in women with  mutations. However, the evidence suggests these medications can significantly lower risk, particularly for women with  mutations.          As with any medication, risk-lowering drugs can have side effects. Depending on the medication taken, these can include an increased risk of blood clots, stroke, osteoporosis or endometrial cancer.     There is no single best approach to managing a high risk of breast cancer. It is a very personal decision that a woman should make together with her physician.  Each of the approaches has its pros and cons (both physical and emotional). Screening in some ways is the easiest option since it doesn\u2019t involve medication or surgery, but it doesn\u2019t lower the risk of breast cancer. Risk-lowering medication can lower risk but can also have side effects.  Prophylactic mastectomy most effectively lowers breast cancer risk, but is the most drastic and irreversible choice.          Which choice is best for a woman depends on how she prefers to approach her risk and the uncertainty of whether or not she\u2019ll go on to develop cancer. This weighing of pros and cons most often reaches beyond the woman herself to include how her decision is also likely to impact her spouse or partner, family, friends and others who depend on her.       Some women who have breast cancer in one breast choose to have a preventive mastectomy to remove the opposite (contralateral) breast to prevent cancer from developing there. This is called contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. The number of women choosing this procedure is increasing., While a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy may lower the risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast, it\u2019s unclear that it actually lengthens life for women with breast cancer.  Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is discouraged unless a woman has a  mutation or other factors that greatly increase the risk of developing a second breast cancer.     If you have a high risk of breast cancer, talk with your health care provider about the pros and cons of all the available options to manage or lower your risk, including bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.  Remember to take the time to make the decisions that are right for you\u2014don\u2019t feel you need to rush.  These decisions are highly personal and your provider can help you choose the method or methods that are right for you.    According to Komen Scholar, Dr. Funda Meric-Bernstam, Chair, Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics and Professor of Surgical Oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, \u201cMany women overestimate their risk of breast cancer. It is important to remember that most breast cancers occur in women that do not have mutations in .  However as they say \"Knowledge is power\"- women with a family history of breast cancer at a young age or ovarian cancer should learn more about the cancer diagnosis of their family members and find out if they have undergone genetic counseling or testing. Women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer should discuss this with their health care providers to get appropriate counseling and cancer screening.         For women with  mutations, prophylactic mastectomy - also now known as \"risk-reducing mastectomy\", is undoubtedly the most effective option to reduce the future risk of breast cancer. The cosmetic results have improved with the introduction of skin-sparing and nipple-sparing mastectomy approaches and immediate reconstruction. However, a reconstructed breast always looks and feels different than the original breast.  This is an important decision that does not need to be rushed. Women with a mutation should be counseled about all of their risk management options including close surveillance, risk-lowering medications, prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) only and prophylactic mastectomy. Psychosocial counseling and discussions about body image and realistic expectations from reconstruction are important parts of personalizing the management plan for each woman.\u201d            Learn more about   and other .

I've had 3 stereotactic biopsies, one atypical \"suspicious\" hyperplasia removed, fibrocystic breast disease, my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at 40 with her FIRST mammogram, so I'm concerned.  I also found that me and my whole family have a particular genetic mutation, MTHFR (677), that may predispose me and them to various forms of cancer (including breast cancer), risk of miscarriages and many other diseases like Alzheimers, autism, depression, and arthritis.  So in researching it more, I found this genetic defect affects one's methylation.  Methylation is essential for the proper function of most body systems and cellular processes. It is also needed to support glutathione production which neutralizes free radicals and supports proper DNA synthesis and repair, helps the body process toxins and other metabolic processes.  It is required for the creation of every cell in your body.  Consequently, it is easy to see how this mutation could have a role in many conditions and diseases.    It is estimated that 40% of the population has this defect.  If you have this mutation, folic acid is actually harmful and will raise your risk of premenopausal breast cancer if taken during pregnancy as with prenatal vitamins containing folic acid.  If you have this mutation, taking estrogen containing birth control will also raise your risk of breast cancer.  There was another post here that was incorrect about the risk of MTHFR defect and folic acid.  In order to circumvent the defect, you need to take a special form of natural folate (MTHF) and avoid folic acid.  If you have an MTHFR defect, you cannot activate folic acid very well and it builds up in your system and can\u2019t be metabolized creating certain problems including depressed immune function , enhanced development and progression of certain cancers, and anemia among others.  Addressing an MTHFR this is relatively easy.  To change one\u2019s folate status, you can take folate (the natural form), and not take folic acid (the synthetic form) which can can be done with a B-complex or multi vitamin containing this natural form of folate, but it isn\u2019t readily available at local outlets, although it is available easily enough online.  Another way to change one\u2019s folate status is to eat enough sources of folate which primarily include green leafy vegetables.  Perhaps that is why the risk of breast cancer is lowest among vegetarians.  A good B complex along with a good multi both containing MTHF folate and NOT folic acid should help anyone with this defect.  Your doctor can test you for it (called the MTHFR defect test, a blood test).  My test was covered by my insurance.  My metabolism has changed since I've been taking it and I feel NORMAL, and a bunch of conditions have resolved, some hormone related like breast cancer.  I'm also convinced that my risk of breast cancer will be decreased from taking it and am looking forward to my next mammogram which will hopefully not be dotted with the dreaded calcifications and suspicious things.  Here is one study that correlates MTHFR mutations with breast cancer and folate status.  If you have MTHFR defect, you can correct your folate status by taking supplements containing MTHF folate, methyl B12, both of which would be found in a good multivitamin and b-complex supplement.  An inverse association of breast cancer risk with folate intake was observed in all MTHFR genotype groups, particularly among subjects with the 677TT genotype. Compared with those with the 677CC genotype and high folate, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) associated with low folate intake were 1.94 (1.15-3.26), 2.17 (1.34-3.51), and 2.51 (1.37-4.60) for subjects who had CC, CT, and TT genotypes (p for interaction, 0.05).

I'm going to appeal the denial but in the meantime I need to have the left removed.  I just didn't want to do one and then have to have the other done at another time.
