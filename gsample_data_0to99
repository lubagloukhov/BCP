S'  Initial Results of PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibitors Evaluated in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Presented in San Antonio   The initial results from a phase 1 trial evaluating the checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda\xc2\xae (pembrolizumab) in patients with heavily pretreated triple-negative breast cancer were recently reported at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS).  The cancer immunotherapy strategy known as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has generated great excitement for its ability to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer. PD-1 is a protein that inhibits certain types of immune responses. Drugs that block PD-1 are called checkpoint inhibitors and may enhance the ability of the immune system to fight cancer. Keytruda is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high-affinity to the PD-1 receptor.   Clinical evidence to date in other cancers is impressive and suggests that Keytruda\xc2\xae and other checkpoint inhibitors such nivolumab, and Yervoy\xc2\xae (ipilimumab) are very effective in melanoma, lymphoma and lung cancer.1-4  Breast cancers display different characteristics that require different types of treatment. The majority of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive, meaning that the cancer cells are stimulated to grow from exposure to the female hormones estrogen and/or progesterone. Other breast cancers are referred to as HER2-positive, which means that they overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a biologic pathway that is involved in replication and growth of a cell. HER2-positive breast cancers account for approximately 25% of breast cancers and are treated with agents that target the receptor to slow growth and replication.  Breast cancers that are not stimulated to grow from exposure to estrogen or progesterone and are HER2-negative are called triple-negative breast cancers. Triple-negative breast cancers tend to be more aggressive than other breast cancers, have fewer treatment options, and were the focus of the current clinical trial.  In this study, 32 patients with recurrent or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer positive for PD-1 were administered Keytruda every 2 weeks until they had either a complete response, partial or stable response, or confirmed disease progression.   Overall, 18.5% of patients responded to treatment with Keytruda. There was one complete response, four partial responses, and seven cases of stable disease.   This clinical trial demonstrates that Keytruda has anti-cancer activity in this hard-to-treat group with advanced triple-negative breast cancer. Investigators are moving forward with phase 2 trials and expect to begin enrollment of patients early in 2015, in the hope that they can improve on the early results. - See more at: <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/Breast-Cancer-News/Initial-Results-of-PD-1-Checkpoint-Inhibitors-Evaluated-in-Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer-Presented-in-San-Antonio.html#sthash.df0vzgEN.dpuf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ww5.komen.org/Breast-Cancer-News/Initial-Results-of-PD-1-Checkpoint-Inhibitors-Evaluated-in-Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer-Presented-in-San-Antonio.html#sthash.df0vzgEN.dpuf</a> '

S'  One thing you should know though... while I can\'t say this is always true, the triple negatives I know all were put on dose-dense chemotherapy which meant they had less time to "rest" between treatment. Since chemo is the only option, they tend to pull out all the stops and let you have it. <br>   <br>  I had chemo every two weeks as opposed to every three weeks which is pretty common. That means there is less time to recover from treatment. I couldn\'t teach during that time as I was just simply too weak. Besides, as an elementary school teacher, the classroom in the spring was not exactly the best place for a chemo patient to be. <br>   <br>  It is rough but it is doable. Like most patients, I counted down the days until I was done. To tell you the truth, radiation was a walk in the park compared to chemo but... I am still here and still cancer-free four years later so was it worth it? Yes. I would do the same thing in a heartbeat! <br>  '

S'  I am so sorry for your loss. I know it is hard to deal with. We just found out that my mom has stage 4 and it is in her organs and bones now. I know my mom was dealing with pain in her hips for a few months and I made her go into the doctor. I did not want to hear what the results were but I am thankful I did. My mom doesnt like to tell us when she has a little bit of pain, and my aunt passed away last year within 3 days of being admitted from what we thought was pneumonia which it really was lung cancer. She knew for 3 months she had it and told us before she passed that she didnt want us to worry about her.&nbsp; '

S'  Study Demonstrates Significant Increase in Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients Electing Double Mastectomy   The number of women with early-stage cancer involving one breast who elect to have both breasts removed has increased significantly, according to a new study of 1.2 million patients published in JAMA Surgery.  Researchers at Vanderbilt University analyzed the medical records of 1.2 million women treated for early-stage breast cancer at major cancer centers between 1998 and 2011.  The proportion of women with early-stage breast cancer who elected to be treated with mastectomy in the affected breast increased from 34 percent to 38 percent during that period. A much more significant trend however was observed for women opting to receive treatment with a double mastectomy which increased from two percent to 11 percent.  Several clinical studies have documented that breast conserving treatment with lumpectomy plus radiation produces similar outcomes to treatment with mastectomy and the trend had been moving away from mastectomy. This study reveals a reversal of the trend toward breast conservation.   The study was unable to identify the reason for the trend toward double mastectomy, but potential reasons might include improvements in breast reconstructive surgery as well as increased fear and anxiety about experiencing a breast cancer recurrence.  Another reason might be an increased awareness of hereditary breast cancer risk as a result of a BRCA genetic mutation. However, the study did not collect data on the number of women who were BRCA positive or who had a family history of breast cancer.   Although there is no right or wrong decision for women with early stage breast cancer who have a choice between treatment with breast conserving surgery or mastectomy, patients should ensure they are fully informed of the risks and benefits of each approach.

S'  Dear Owlet:  I too found my lump that was not there a couple of weeks before. But I was on a diet and suspect that I lost just enough "padding" in my breast to make the tumor obvious.  As for the approval you got for the genetic test - I think you should play it safe and ask for something in writing. Otherwise, you might be in for a nasty surprise when a bill arrives. You do not want to be told that whoever "approved" you was not authorized to do so and "does not work here anymore".  Good luck and keep us posted. '

S'  Hi all!  Thank you for all you posts......  let me give you an update...........The drain is out but the hole from it is still ozzing. I see the breast doc on Friday. My mom had breast cancer and also still has non hodgekins lymphoma. We took her to Fox Chase Cancer Center and she  is still here 21 years later. After many hours of coaxing ( she was on my back to go to Fox Chase real bad) I went to see the medical oncologist at Fox Chase and was floored. Fox Chase got the slides and did their own pathology report.  The hospital where the tumor was removed states it is not in the lymph node except isolated in one.  Es/Pro +  her2-.....Fox chase stated micrometastasis 0.03 cm with ocular micrometer in one node.... HER2 equivocal....they sent it out for FISH testing. More questions......more waiting.... Do I go for a third opinion? Fox Chase is talking chemo with heratin radiation and hormone therapy. They offered me a clinical trial. I have to wait for the FISH testing to come back.......any one hear of this happening or is it just my luck??? '

S'  Cate, my heart goes out to you....normal, is there such a thing????  If there is, you are in my mind very normal...I went thru just what you describe...  Of course you are terrified, of course you have a multitude of fears and concerns.    IT IS OKAY TO FEEL THIS WAY!!!!  ( Might be good idea to ask Dr. for a stress pill though for your own sake...I call them chill pills. LOL.    We are here for you....I found this site to be a saving grace for me....so stick around.  I am in Mexico and thus it is typical for someone to stay with you in hospital if possible.  My husband was able to stay with me for my surgery.  I ahve had many other hospitalizations, some alone and some with my mother staying.  It sort of all depends on you, how you feel, if you want your friend around etc...just a thought would you ratehr have hubby stay withyou or no, if so is there no one who could stay with kids, maybe the friend?  Or maybe you rather have a girlfriend with you, or even be alone, all a choice for you.     Welcome to the club you never wanted to join, welcome to being our sister a Komen sister.   I wish  you the best and will keep you in my thoughts!!!  Sending you cyber hugs! '

I hope and pray the VERY best for your Mawmaw and wish I could give you an encouraging hug right now! Not to pry but I'm curious as to your grandma's age.  I know it's a scary time for you right now.  Also consider resources available via the American Cancer Society for relatives of cancer patients.    You'll find sometimes you don't get all of the answers in just one doctor's visit.  Be patient...it's part of the process...as annoying as that is sometimes!  Prayerfully,   Suzanne "

With high indicators showing likelihood of contracting male breast cancer we got into action. <br>    <br>  Oncologist suggested late last year that preventative could be an option, so in January he decided to pursue this option, all tissue tested negative. <br>  What he thought was going to be a quick easy procedure turned out to be more. <br>    <br>  Shortly after that his mother was diagnosed with stomach cancer, &nbsp;has finished her multiple chemo sessions and all results show no sign of cancer - thank god! <br>    <br>  I am grateful that we are resting in calmer waters but the emotional roller coaster has taken its toll - I am awake at 4:30 am worried about my husband and feel the whole experience has left him emasculated and depressed. &nbsp;Although willing to have this procedure is unwilling to seek counselling or reach out for support. <br>    <br>  Any wisdom would be gratefully appreciated <br>  '

S'  Give it a little time. &nbsp;You said you had reconstruction. &nbsp;If they used tissue expanders, then yes the pulling is normal. &nbsp;They had to make a pocket to put the expander in. &nbsp;This is just under your muscle so the pulling has a great deal to do with the stitches to close the pocket. &nbsp;Over time it will become easier to move and the pulling will stop. &nbsp;You are only two weeks out. &nbsp;Add the trauma of the node removal and you still have a great deal of swelling to contend with. &nbsp;   <br>   <br> I know the tightness and soreness from the expanders. &nbsp;I actually popped at stitch. &nbsp;When that stitch popped all the tightness stopped and I felt so relieved. &nbsp;It was under the skin and the doctor didn\'t worry about it. <br>    <br>  As far as your husband goes, everyone has to deal with this in their own way even though it hurts you. &nbsp;Give him some time if you can. &nbsp; <br>    <br>  Any concerns that you have, mention them to your doctor on your next visit. &nbsp;This is all so new that everything will be a learning experience. &nbsp;Congrats on not needing further treatment. &nbsp;That is a plus! &nbsp; <br>    <br>  If you would like to talk more, send me a private message. &nbsp;Again, take it easy as time is needed. &nbsp;Scars will eventually fade but a new "you" is still a work in progress. <br>    <br>    <br>  '

After reading all your comments, it brings some easy to my mind that I will be ok. Today, I am having a lunch at my home with my family to tell them. I am provide them with information on what to watch out for and also supplying them with supplement that will help prevent cancer. I am the first of my family to have this, as I know so far. It going to be a busy week for me, surgery on Monday. Right now I feel ok. '

S"  Hi and welcome, I'm sorry your Mom is facing this again for the third time, it sounds like she did all she could to help prevent a recurrance but no one knows why some recurr and others do not. Its always a worry of course that the cancer may have spread to a distant organ or bones and hard as it is try to be patient until she gets the results of her scans although I know the waiting is the worst and I really hope the cancer will be contained and any treatment will be minimal.   <br>   <br> Your Mom could ask her Dr about genetic testing both for her and you if you wanted, usually its done if there's a family history, otherwise keep doing those breast checks and attending for your Mammo's and please keep us posted on how your Mom is doing . <br>    <br>    <br>  "

S"  Sue - so good to see you here.&nbsp; No the decisions never seem to end!&nbsp; I am not sure - you know me - I don't have much faith in mammo - nothing ever showed up on mine.&nbsp; But I am not sure if I would want to give it up completely.&nbsp;  <br>   <br>  My surgeon still has me on 6 months alternating mammo/mri.&nbsp; She has me set up for a mammo at the end of summer - so we will see what she says after that visit.&nbsp; My mri is usually in Jan.&nbsp; I just saw my rad onc and she seemed to lean toward going to usual protocol of annual mammo alone - but said that my surgeon can make that decision.&nbsp; Funny thing - they both were supposed to d/c me at two years - protocol.&nbsp; Surgeon decreased visits to every 6 months and rad onc decreased to annual visits.&nbsp; I questioned this and they said I still have too much stuff going on!! <br>   <br>  Be sure to let your doctor know how you feel and what your concerns are.&nbsp; We will have to talk soon.&nbsp; I am thinking a summer trip to Minnesota would be fun! <br>  Blessings, <br>  Cathy <br>  "

S"  Ashley I'm sorry for all your Mom has been thorugh and is going through and I'm baffled how this mistake could have happened if she had a biopsy. I'm sure some of the Lobular ladies can comment more on the dx but from the little I know of it, some people do class it as something that without treatment probably will go on to develop into cancer so looking at it that way I'm sure you're both relieved your Mom is still here and will be for many years to come to enjoy her life. I can't comment on your position as the law could be different there than here but I'd just let your Mom know you're there for her as you have been all along, and for most ladies with a similar op recovery  should get easier very soon.

S'  Can I just say that I am giving myself brain damage reading and researching all the information. I was diaginosed on Jun 11, 2013 with intermediate stage DCIS of the right breast. I had two lumpectomies without clean margins however the surgical nurse called me after the second surgery to indicate the margins WERE clean. It was not until I went for a second opinion on radiation when I learned that I had less than 1 cc margins and no clean margins on one section. I called a left a message for the BC surgeon and never heard back, I called the nurse navigator twice did not hear back although she promised to return my call. I went to my Oncologist and said what is going on? She raised the flag and I got a call from their radiologist who fit me in asap to discuss the findings. In the meantime I went to see Angelina Jolie\'s doctor and she said in her opinion the margins were not acceptable and ordered a contrast MRI. I also went to another family recommended top female breast and reconstrutive surgeon as AJ\'s doctor is a bit of a drive. The MRI is showing all kinds of abnomalities now in both breasts and they are starting to use the term invasive. I am going to have another baseline MRI, and then most likely an MRI double biopsy. I am grateful that the doctor ordered the MRI and I am trying to wash the bitter taste out of my month from my original lack of care.&nbsp; I think it is wrong to call it "just DCIS" - I realize that I am fortunate but if the test come back unfavorable I could have been walking around undiagnosed. <br>  &nbsp; <br>  I spend all my free time going to doctors and hoping and praying that the MRI is a false positive. Getting all the DCIS out is like the game finding Waldo.....and I am determined to get that little bugger.&nbsp; I am intriged that my most recent mammo show an all clear yet the contrast MRI (done the same day) shows so much more. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. <br>  '

S' Sandy- <br>  <br> I\'m probably a bit of an anomaly.  I\'m 36, have had a bilateral mastectomy and I\'ve had both the TRAM and the DIEP flap.  (I didn\'t have enough tissue in either to do both breasts and I wasn\'t a candidate for implants because the cancer was in my chest wall)  I had the TRAM done in 01/04 to reconstruct my right side and a DIEP done in 10/04 to reconstruct my left side.  To be totally honest, neither surgery was a cake walk--they were both very long.  The TRAM was 12 hours and the DIEP was 16 (due to complications).  I\'ve recovered completely from both though, and have no complaints.  Although I\'ve lost some sensation in my abdomen, I haven\'t lost any stregnth--I do sit-ups with no problem and I\'m a runner. <br> The DIEP reconstruction is firmer than the TRAM reconstruction.  (my doctor said the TRAM side is more "realistic" given the gravity factor women face--I said to heck with that, if I have to go through all this, I\'m getting the boobs of a 17 year old!!  lol) <br>  <br> I didn\'t do the subcutanious mastectomy, my oncologist was against it because of the aggressive nature of my cancer. <br>  <br> Best of luck and God Bless! <br>  <br> Traci <br>  <br> > >I am 40 years old.

S'  Dear special sisters -  I joined this family on 10/05/2011.  Like all of you, I am still trying to understand how my life is changed.  I was diagnosed 10/05 with stage 2 triple neg, grade 3, multifocal.  10/28 had SNB (micromet in one node) and mastectomy.  Starting chemo this week, possibly to follow with rad. Problem: want to and need to return to work; have 12 weeks FMLA but it will not cover all of treatment; work with infants and toddlers with developmental delays and disabilities; many have congenital viral infections, others have chronic illnesses and are frequently sick; concerned about exposure when on chemo. Does any one have any ideas? Thanks in advance for your help. '

I've also learned sadly that bc really is a crap shoot having lost friends that had a far better prognosis than I did!!!:( "

S'  For me, the worst side-effects were mouth sores and shooting pains in my legs. I think Taxol may have caused the pains. One thing I will tell you is that if you do not want your hair coming out in patches in the shower, your car, into the lettuce bin at the grocery store etc. - have your head shaved after your second chemo. That way you are in "control". I also do not recommend spending money on a wig. We are entering the warmer months and wigs are warm. They can also be tight fitting. I preferred to use cotton head scarves. I had several in different colors and patterns that went with various outfits.***********Good luck and keep us posted. '

S'  There is much Research ongoing far exceeding the 2 Links you give and it\'s being funded. &nbsp;There are already vaccines for Cervical and one type of Liver Cancer, these are caused by Viruses which the body can easily spot as Enemies once the vaccine is given. &nbsp;The issue with non viral Cancers is that the Body doesn\'t recognise them as enemies.&nbsp;   <br>   <br> Coupled with the fact that there are many types and sub types of various Cancers, including Breast Cancer, the challenge is daunting. <br>    <br>  Let\'s hope it happens, but it is some years off, in the meantime treating Cancer once it arrives is the only option. &nbsp; <br>    <br>  It could be there will never be a Vaccine or a "Cure" but I am not put off giving funds to achieve better treatments and better long term survival rates.&nbsp; <br>    <br>    <br>   <br>  '

S'  I\'m very unfaithful on this board, sorry! But I am doing \'maintenance\' treatment with Faslodex & zometa monthly and still working full time.  My thyroid is worse than it used to be, but most of the synthetic meds give me side effects so I\'m not taking anything for it right now.  I noticed more joint/bone pain when I was on Femara.  I was told frankly that my joints will hurt when I exercise even on Faslodex, but I need to to do it much more than I am!  I had been faithfully doing the recumbent bike but got out of it when taking care of my hubby (he had a sudden blockage in an artery...something similar to what killed John Ritter a few years ago...very rare artery to block, only 100 cases, etc...2 surgeries in Sept and 3 weeks in hospital, and I\'m just so glad he\'s survived it!  Now we are both survivors of something!  But he\'s still had chronic diarrhea since being released and losing weight...so I\'m concerned about that and open for any tips, as "they" are still trying to figure out when he will \'firm up.\'   Whew...sorry so long!

S"  Hi Tracy,   <br>   <br> I am terribly sorry for the double whammy that was dealt to you and your family. &nbsp;As far as the emotions, they go all over the place. &nbsp;The waiting makes your mind wander and fear takes over. &nbsp;There are a whole gauntlet of emotions and unfortunately they don't shut off easily. <br>    <br>  With the lumpectomy, I really didn't have a lot of pain, just when I went to close the car door, but then again I didn't have nodes removed. &nbsp;The nerves are a major problem as they will drive you crazy. &nbsp;Since they were cut, they are trying to regenerate or repair themselves. &nbsp;I went from one moment in pain to the next feeling like there was an uncontrollable itch. Still have that issue and it's been over two years. <br>    <br>  As far as your family goes, play it by ear. &nbsp;I agree that it is best to have your game plan as far as treatments laid out. &nbsp;Be prepared as there will be a great deal of questions and make sure that you have an idea of what you might be comfortable talking about. &nbsp;There are no easy answers when dealing with this disease but there never seems to be a shortage of questions. &nbsp;Know that there are long term survivors on this site and that we are here for you. <br>    <br>  &nbsp; <br>  "

I did have side effects of joint stiffness but found I could live with that, so far I'm really not noticing any improvement from stopping so perhaps old age is rushing in! &nbsp;Depending on how high your hormone status is/was you could perhaps give Arimidex or Aromasin a try? &nbsp;Please keep us posted and I hope you begin to feel better soon. <br>  "

Aromatase inhibitors block the production of estrogen in postmenopausal women. These drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, but may also have a role in breast cancer prevention\xe2\x80\x94particularly in women at high risk of the disease.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>   <br>  <font face="arial">The International Breast cancer Intervention Study II (IBIS-II) included 3,864 postmenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer. (High risk was defined by family history or prior diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, or atypical ductal hyperplasia.) The women were randomly assigned to take 1 mg of Arimidex or placebo daily for five years. The women underwent breast exam and mammogram at baseline and every two years thereafter during the study.</font>&nbsp; <br>   <br>  <font face="arial">After a median follow-up of five years, 40 women in the Arimidex group (2%) and 85 women in the placebo group (4%) had developed breast cancer. The predicted cumulative incidence of all breast cancers after seven years was 5.6 percent in the placebo group and 2.8 percent in the Arimidex group. The number needed to treat was 36 to prevent one breast cancer in seven years of follow-up. Side effects associated with estrogen deprivation, were only slightly more frequent in the Arimidex group than in the placebo group.</font>&nbsp; <br>   <br>  <font face="arial">The researchers concluded that Arimidex effectively reduces the incidence of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. In fact, they found that the primary prevention effect was larger than that reported for another aromatase inhibitor, Armosain&#174; (exemestane) and two other drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen and Evista&#174; (raloxifene).&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>   <br>  <font face="arial">As a result of these findings, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Arimidex will be added to the breast cancer prevention&nbsp;</font><font face="arial">guidelines, as Aromasin was earlier in 2013.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>   <br>  <b><font face="arial">Reference:</font></b>&nbsp; <br>  <font face="arial">Cuzick J, Sestak I, Forbes JF, et al.

S"  Hi all,   <br>   <br> My lovely wife is getting hit with taxol, carboplatin, herceptin, and perjeta. &nbsp;She was great for two days following her first round, but on day 3 she got diarrhea that hasn't really subsided even with double doses of Imodium and then getting a prescription for Imotil. &nbsp;Her oncologist is following and is going to come up with a plan to get this under control. &nbsp;In the meantime, has anyone else experienced this and what worked for you? <br>    <br>  I'm concerned about her going into Trx #2 in a semi-weakened state and also about allowing the diarrhea stay chronic beyond a week or two. <br>    <br>  Thoughts? <br>  "

S"  Hi Mandy. Good for you for being proactive. Of course, being proactive means that you will probably have some uncertain things that come up and have to be investigated. Yes, the waiting is awful. Try not to read too much more on the Internet. So much of what you read won't even apply to you, and some information is not accurate. I wish you the best and hope that you get benign results. Let us know. "

S'  {{I\'m sorry you too are having to make this humongous decision!!!}} <br>   <br>  When I was first dx and told I would have a left breast mastectomy. I went immediately to the place of double mastectomy (since my right breast was hurting and no one was finding anything). I was very adamant about not doing reconstruction. <br>   <br>  I\'m a big, fluffy old bird. And I\'d done a lot of reading about the connection between weight, high blood sugar, inflammation and breast cancer recurrence. So I wanted and want to do anything to minimize my inflammatory load and to reduce my weight and blood sugars! <br>   <br>  I knew that I did not want to live with foreign bodies in my chest. I felt they would increase inflammation and give a low level constant challenge to my immune system. I didn\'t think I would be a candidate for a DIEP flap recon because of my blood sugars and lungs and the long surgery and hard recovery. <br>   <br>  But then I met my plastic surgeon and he explained so much to me. He hasn\'t seen a relationship between implants and inflammation/recurrence in his patients. He also said it was a WIN/WIN situation. That if for any reason I was unhappy with it, he would take them out, do the revisions and get me back on the road to recovery. That we would work until I was happy. <br>   <br>  That made me feel good. He also said he thought that they could do DIEP on me and that made me feel even better. I would have natural tissue in my breasts and have a reduction in fat from my abdomen. Both had to be better on the inflammation I thought! <br>   <br>  So on Nov 1, I had a double mastectomy with Alloderm Cadaver Muscle Flaps and Tissue Expanders placed. A week and a day later, I\'m up and doing laundry (no heavy lifting or moving my elbows up above shoulder heighth. It\'s still no picnic. I still have a cough and have sinking spells every afternoon around 5pm just like a 2year old! But I\'m able to manage pain with Advil and Vicodin at night to sleep. <br>   <br>  I hope I don\'t regret this reconstruction process. Experience has taught me that every time I go contrary to my gut instinct I regret it somewhere down the road. I just have to pray I made the right choice. <br>   <br>  I have had a hate-hate relationship with my body since puberty. I think because of my weight, I\'ve always had a poor body image. I\'ve always been big chested and there were so many things I couldn\'t do well because of them (sports, golf, clothing limitations). When I was dx, I just felt like they had "let me down" and were a weak part of my body. So I was all, "Well let\'s get em the hell outta here!" No regrets. <br>   <br>  Well now that they are gone, I don\'t think I have regrets, but I keep waiting to feel some sadness about it. I feel like a freak cuz I don\'t have the womanly feelings of emotional attachment to them. In my experience, they were more of a nuisance than an integral part of who I am as a person. I wish I felt "normal" and felt like my breasts were important to me. I will miss the feelings and intimacy. But I haven\'t been intimate in so long cuz of feeling so bad physically the past 6+ years that truthfully, it\'s hard to remember how good the feelings felt? If that makes any sense? <br>   <br>  So my advice to you would be seriously take stock of where you are at...while you are alone and quiet. For me that kind of self-exam takes place in the wee hours of night when everything is quiet and still. Then I let myself think and feel things. No one thing will be right for every person. We are all so individual and have such different experiences/backgrounds. <br>   <br>  Then once you decide what is right, never forget why you made the decisions you made. Just don\'t second guess and embrace life head on with arms open wide! '

S"  What your friend is doing is committing fraud and yes, it is not only morally wrong, it is a crime. Unfortunately this happens more than one might think.   <br>   <br> A few years ago, there was a man in the Christian music industry who was caught doing this. He went so far as to even have people drop him off and pick him up outside of the hospital where he was supposedly having chemo treatment. I can't remember how he was caught but I think someone had stopped into see him and there was no record of him...&nbsp; <br>    <br>  At the time, I was a part of a blogging site and I would blog about my experiences with cancer and other health issues I have. I remember suddenly wondering if my readers might wonder about me. I was very glad that I'd had a number of people who came to see me during chemo treatments, a friend in addition to a couple of family members who'd gone with me to see my oncologist, have medical records from the clinic and hospital and so forth.&nbsp; <br>    <br>  Cancer is actually quite difficult to hide...unless you are a fraud, of course.&nbsp; <br>  "

S'  The only time I felt some panic was shortly before I was to go to surgery.&nbsp; I told the anesthesist that I didn\'t want to lose it in front of my family.&nbsp; He told me "I\'ll take care of it".&nbsp; Next thing I know I was sleeping.&nbsp; I was so grateful for that.&nbsp; I had been so strong in front of my family, that I knew if they saw me crack they all would have gone to pieces.&nbsp; I had written each of them a letter that I gave them to be opened as they were waiting for me to come back from surgery.&nbsp; Instructions on what I wanted from them.&nbsp; To make me laugh, to hold my hand, to believe I would be fine etc.&nbsp; Some very personal stuff between the mother, sister, wife I am to each of my girls, sister and dear hubby.&nbsp; The time it took me to write those letters and the tears it invoked was something I felt I needed to do.&nbsp; You know, no one dies from this surgery but boy I wanted to be sure to have all bases covered.&nbsp; I wanted to know that I wouldn\'t see pity in their eyes when I came to.&nbsp; I wanted them to know I would be there for them and would deal with the loss of my breasts just fine.&nbsp; So some of the time prior to surgery was spent doing such things.&nbsp; I even had a file on my computer where I wrote to myself.&nbsp; Trying to convince myself of how strong I would need to be not only for me but for my family.&nbsp; It helped me get determined so that I wouldn\'t succumb to my own fears.&nbsp; I guess I don\'t think about this part too much as it does make me feel very sad for that woman who was trying to be so brave but really was scared out of her mind.&nbsp; Seeing your posts has caused me to reflect on those emotions I had during the days building up to surgery.&nbsp; The night before I went in, I was even drawing pictures to show my husband what the surgery does and the scars that are left.&nbsp; I was trying to help him come to terms and answer any questions that he was afraid to ask.&nbsp; We all do what we need to do for our own sake and I think by my focussing on my family and worrying about them kept me from thinking about myself.&nbsp; I so wish you well.&nbsp; This is not an easy time but you will find on the otherside of this surgery that you will get your focus back.&nbsp; Take care!!

S'  Hi Phillip,   <br>   <br>      Changes in symmetry reports from a mammogram is really a non-specific finding, and the incidence of this eventually turning out to be cancer is low.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to ask the radiologist regarding the BIRADS category of your mammogram, since we will know from this category if the findings are benign or if this would warrant further treatment.&nbsp;  The BIRADS categories are as follows:&nbsp;  0 - Incomplete - Additional tests are necessary to further evaluate the findings, or follow up may be needed&nbsp;  1 - Negative - No imaging findings; recommends routine screening&nbsp;  2 - Benign - There are mammogram findings, but benign in nature; still recommends routine screening&nbsp;  3 - Probably Benign - Breast mammogram findings are most likely benign (&gt;90%), short term follow up test is necessary&nbsp;  4 - Suspicious - Breast findings have probability of a malignant nature, biopsy is recommended.&nbsp;  5 - Highly Suspicious of Cancer -&nbsp;The breast&nbsp;findings have a very high chance of being malignant (&gt;90%). Biopsy or more definitive treatment is recommended.&nbsp;  Good luck to you both and please keep us posted! <br>    <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  '

S"  What helped me to get back my range of motion after my mastectomy was to massage the mastectomy site.&nbsp; I would wake up with it feeling tight or after sitting in the same position at my desk, typing and using the mouse.&nbsp; My PT had me just massage the incision area gently.&nbsp; I had been doing all the exercise I was given by my surgeon, but it wasn't enough.&nbsp; (The exercises I was given were the same ones in the book Dr Susan Love's Breast Book.)&nbsp; I did have some cording at my first PT appointment, but after the PT worked on my arm and doing the exercises/massages, I haven't had it since.&nbsp; This was almost&nbsp;a year ago now.&nbsp;  <br>   <br>  I was recommended by a couple people to work with an occupational therapist rather than a physical therapist for lymphedema.&nbsp; They need to be certified lymphedema therapists, but seemed to get more things I could do at home from the occupational therapists.&nbsp; The physical therapist gave me exercises and that was pretty much it.&nbsp; The occupational therapist gave me the same exercises and both did the manual lymph drain massage, but the OT also had me do the compression bandaging, which wearing while doing the exercises really helped my lymphedema.&nbsp; I went to both, needing to&nbsp;wear the sleeve daily.&nbsp; Now after working with the occupational therapist, the swelling is down, and I don't need to wear the sleeve daily.&nbsp; I know what tends to trigger mine and use the sleeve as prevention for when needing to do something that&nbsp;is&nbsp;a trigger (plane rides, long car rides).&nbsp; My OT said it was about learning how to manage living with lymphedema - not putting up with the symptoms, but how to deal with it on my own, so that I don't need to keep seeing a therapist. <br>   <br>  PM me if you have any questions. <br>   <br>  Cathy "

S"  Hi Lucy,   <br>   <br> I had the same drugs but with Herceptin added to the Taxol as I was her2+, I did find all the drugs had a cumulative effect but it was doable and overall I felt Taxol was easier to tolerate than A/C which I found very tough indeed. &nbsp;My hair did grow back on Taxol and I was receiving it every week in a lower dose, it grew back curly (which I'd never had) and a gry/white colour so was glad to colour it myself asap! &nbsp; <br>    <br>  Bad news was that I lost a couple of fingernails so its a good idea to keep them short, also my eye lashes and brows, everyone is different and I hope you find it easy to tolerate too.&nbsp; <br>    <br>  I had had surgery before chemo so had no way to check if it was working, I'm guessing your Onc will order a scan when the a/c is completed to see if its working, good luck. <br>  "

S"  Hi Kathy and Tammy,   <br>   <br> Sorry to hear you are both dealing with this. &nbsp;I too am in the medical profession and found that to be most helpful. &nbsp;I felt equipped to know what questions to ask and how to interpret the answers. &nbsp;My physicians were open and straightforward with me. &nbsp;I often felt I was able to put my mind into it's caregiver state to focus on what my body needed instead of feeling sorry for myself. &nbsp;Do tap into your resources to seek the best care available to you. <br>    <br>  And then there's those precious grandchildren.... my grandson brought me joy and smiles every time I started feeling down. :) <br>    <br>  Leah <br>  "

It's been a roller coaster with the expanders, some days I feel pretty good and other days I'm miserable. How do the implants compare? Also, my PS says it's a much shorter recovery and I should only be out of work a week or 2. Is that your experience?&nbsp; <br>    <br>  Thank you! <br>  Elizabeth <br>  "

S"  I had the DIEP flap procedure done two years ago. &nbsp;I have been very pleased with the result. &nbsp;You basically get a free tummy tuck because they take your excess abdominal tissue and make your new breasts out of that. &nbsp;It involves microsurgery to reattach blood vessels and I was in ICU for two nights being closely monitored to make sure the new breast was being fed by the reattached blood vessels. &nbsp;My total hospital stay was 5 nights - 2 in ICU and 3 on a med/surg floor. &nbsp;You go home with drains in your breast(s) and abdomen that must be measured and emptied several times a day (my husband did this). &nbsp;You will be more sore from the tummy tuck than from the actual reconstruction. &nbsp;In the hospital I was on a morphine pump. &nbsp;I also had some potent pain meds at home. &nbsp;I slept in a recliner for 2 weeks because getting into a prone position was very painful (I have a high four-poster bed, so that might not be the case if you don't). &nbsp;The drains were removed on week two. &nbsp;I ended up with an infection in the reconstruction on week 4 and had to go back to the hospital for IV antibiotics, then wound therapy afterwards. &nbsp;This is not the norm, though! &nbsp;I'd say it probably was a good 6 weeks before I felt normal again. &nbsp;I would definitely do it again! &nbsp;I had been wanting a tummy tuck for 15 years, so that was a very nice side benefit of being diagnosed with bc!

She was only forty and there was'nt a dry eye in the church as you can imagine. <br>  My best to your friend and to you, try to take it in your stride as you're able.

S'  Tricia, you might wish to consider adding fish oil for the joint pain. My med onc suggested that&nbsp;because a study being done at my "Cancer Walmart" is indicating that fish oil helps some people. I don\'t have pain as much as stiffness upon getting up from a chair or bed&nbsp;and actually found that a cane works rather well to&nbsp;help me manage&nbsp;the first several steps more smoothly and securely. Once I\'m going, I\'m fine, but those first half dozen steps are iffy. <br>   <br>  I take black cohosh for the hot flashes from Arimidex but recently added fish oil and now rarely have one. There\'s another bonus of fish oil for me. '

I'm looking for any advice on how to lessen and make side effects as tolerable as possible. I know everyone is different but how soon after a treatment will I notice side effects? What are the most common side effects? I've heard so many horrible stories that I am so scared!!! I heard that when you hair begins to fall out that it feels like your hair is being pulled hard. "

S"  Hi Patty,  This means the more estrogen in your body,the more it was fueling or feeding the tumour so the trick now is to lower as much as possible bu taking hormone therapy. I take Arimidex but your Dr may decide on Femara (its sister drug) or Aromasin, all three help prevent the aromatase from converting into estrogen in your body and its recently been thought that ten years is better than five.  I doubt you'll go through menopause again now that you've had surgery, they do have some side effects with some people, bone loss and joint pain for some, I've been taking it for eight years so far and find the side effects manageable and better than a recurrance. If you check out the hormone therapy forum you'll got lots more info there too.  Your Dr may do a bone density (DEXA) scan when you begin taking it as a baseline, this is usually repeated in a couple of years so they can get tell if there's been any bone loss and prescribe meds to help counteract it, sorry I cant help on price though.

S"  I am 34 years old and my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 42 and her mother, (my grandmother), also had breast cancer in her early 40's. &nbsp;My mother will not do the brac testing so I do not know if she has the gene. &nbsp;I found a lump in my right breast 2 years ago. &nbsp;I have small dense breasts and they could not see it on my mammogram at that time. &nbsp;They said I had a small nodule after an ultrasound was done but it was nothing to worry about. &nbsp;They did two more ultrasounds over the course of the next 6 months and said it had not changed and I didn't need to continue with the ultrasounds. &nbsp;Fast forward 6 months. &nbsp;Last month the lump felt slightly larger so I mentioned it when I just had my yearly mammo, this time they did see something on the mammo that required further imaging. Another ultrasound was done and they stated I had a lump, never said what type or any additional info, but that it appeared to look benign. &nbsp;They recommended that I return again in 3 months for another ultrasound. &nbsp;I am just trying to determine if them stating that it appears to be benign is good enough to move forward without worrying it could be cancer. &nbsp;Can it appear benign and still be cancer? &nbsp;I have not gotten my questions fully answered by my gyno as I have to communicate through her nurse when I call. &nbsp;With my family history should I be requesting a biopsy even though they do not feel it is necessary?&nbsp;   <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>   <br>  "

S"  I had mastectomy with expander, chemotherapy, followed by radiation. &nbsp;I waited 9 mos after rads to have expander exchanged for silicone implant and a lift on the other breast. &nbsp;The tissue transfer surgeries were not an option because I did not want them (LAT FLAP, DIEP, etc.). &nbsp;My surgeries were successful, no infections, etc. &nbsp;My breasts are very symmetrical; however, the implant side does not 'jiggle' because radiation has an effect on the tissue. &nbsp;It can be annoying because it feels 'stuck' to my chest' and when I move my arm, my breast doesn't move out the way :) &nbsp;Nonetheless, I'm very happy with the results....I had no pain, no infection, absolutely no problems and for that I am grateful. &nbsp;I use temporary tattoos to 'dress her up' because I also chose not to have a nipple tattoo or replacement. &nbsp;She has her own look and her own personality :)&nbsp;   <br>   <br> Hope this helps. <br>    <br>  Hug <br>  Elaine <br>    <br>   <br>  "

S'  For me, the worst side-effects were mouth sores and shooting pains in my legs. I think Taxol may have caused the pains. One thing I will tell you is that if you do not want your hair coming out in patches in the shower, your car, into the lettuce bin at the grocery store etc. - have your head shaved after your second chemo. That way you are in "control". I also do not recommend spending money on a wig. We are entering the warmer months and wigs are warm. They can also be tight fitting. I preferred to use cotton head scarves. I had several in different colors and patterns that went with various outfits.***********Good luck and keep us posted. '

Thursday, October 8, 2009 6:00-7:00 PM PST <br>              Lead Author: Heather L. McArthur, MD, MPH Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center New York, NY <br>              Women with small node-negative HER2+ breast tumors appear to benefit             from adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin) treatment: Based on a review of             approximately 500 records of patients treated between Jan. 2002 and             Dec. 2008, researchers found that women with small (2 cm or less)             HER2-positive breast cancers that had not spread to lymph nodes who             received trastuzumab-based treatment after surgery had significantly             better outcomes than a comparable population of women treated before             trastuzumab was available (Jan. 2002 through May 15, 2004). In the             trastuzumab-treated group, there was only one death and no recurrences.             In the trastuzumab-naive group, there were ten locoregional             recurrences, nine distant recurrences and six deaths. In the U.S.,             adjuvant trastuzumab is FDA-approved in combination with chemotherapy             for the treatment of node-positive or high-risk, node-negative,             HER2-positive breast cancer; however, whether women with lower risk,             HER2-positive breast cancer derive benefit from trastuzumab has not             been established. <br>              \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a provocative analysis suggesting a significant benefit in             disease- free survival for patients with Stage I breast cancer who             received trastuzumab,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lori Pierce, MD, Professor, Radiation             Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine.\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be             important to test this hypothesis prospectively to be sure the             potential benefit of trastuzumab is not over-estimated in this low-risk             patient population.\xe2\x80\x9d <br>                                                                       <img src="http://her2support.org/vbulletin/images/statusicon/user_offline.gif">             <a href="http://her2support.org/vbulletin/report.php?p=211725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://her2support.org/vbulletin/images/buttons/report.gif"></a>             &nbsp;                                                    <a href="http://her2support.org/vbulletin/newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=211725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://her2support.org/vbulletin/images/buttons/quote.gif"></a>                 <br>  '

S"  Hi,  <br> DCIS is a tough one. &nbsp;I had stage 0 DCIS and when I had the lumpectomy my margins were not clean. &nbsp;Based on the path report, the surgeon felt that another lumpectomy would not come out clean either so a mastectomy was recommended. &nbsp;As he stated he took a sample of 9cm and it was filled from one side to another. &nbsp;They ended up doing 11 slides and all had the cells. &nbsp;I also found out there was LCIS that didn't show up on a mammo, or ultrasound. <br>    <br>  It is hard to find out exactly how much is there until a path report. When it was recommended that I have the mastectomy I then had a breast MRI. &nbsp;Not a wonderful/comfortable thing. &nbsp;When the path report after the mastectomy came back I was told the that entire breast was filled with DCIS/LCIS that just didn't show up on the Mammo. &nbsp;Not sure how much showed up with the MRI as that was being mostly done as a diagnostic on the good breast to try to help me determine between a bilateral mastectomy and a single. <br>    <br>  I can understand the frustration. &nbsp;You will get through this. &nbsp; <br>  "

S"  I know that when the Surgical Onc tells you something about further treatment, they may not be right. Mine thought I would have a lumpectomy and radiation. It was when I went to the Medical Onc that things changed. I should say that when I mentioned recurrence score, it equates to a percentage of likelihood that the cancer will come back and/or spread. In my case the score of 25 meant that I had a 16% chance of it coming back or spreading. This meant that the damage from chemo was less than the benefit I would realize of decreasing that recurrence percentage rate. My Med Onc did not tell me how many Rads I would have to get, he left that to the Radiation Onc. So be prepared for lots of different Dr's and their recommendations on treatment. I just finished my Rads last Thursday and have started my Tamoxifen. It is a long process but definitely survivable. I am glad to share even a little bit of the knowledge I have learned along the way. "

S"  Life is too short to worry about yogurt I agree, I also am a smoker and think there is far more to the causes and progession of bc than the obvious, but sadly I dont think one size fits all and if it were simply dairy/yogurt/red meat/ whatever ...life would be easier and we could know we'll avoid a recurrance but bc has too many sub types etc so worrying about dairy I feel is a waste of time of effort!   I've also learned sadly that bc really is a crap shoot having lost friends that had a far better prognosis than I did!!!:( "

I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite sure if I had that much to tell at this point in my life, or that it was enough to really warrant a discussion with the public. But I do now. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re well on our way to finding strategies to keep people with advanced diseases alive longer. I guess I wanted people to know where I believe we\xe2\x80\x99re going. And for young people, particularly, who look at things as most young people do as overnight success stories. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying we\xe2\x80\x99re the greatest success\xe2\x80\x94and I would not think we\xe2\x80\x99re the greatest success until people can live long and normal lives with breast cancer\xe2\x80\x94but I do feel that this has been a long-term commitment. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a generation of work. </font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>Q: You tell the story of a reporter who was at your first fundraiser. She wrote an article that used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbreast cancer,\xe2\x80\x9d which is one of the first times that phrase found its way into print. How did you get that term mainstreamed?</b></font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>A:</b> Young people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that there actually was a time in their parents\xe2\x80\x99 lives when you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t print the word \xe2\x80\x9cbreast\xe2\x80\x9d in newspapers and magazines. Many young people don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize that this subject was not spoken about when I was young. It was called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big C.\xe2\x80\x9d I realized if we were going to change the clinic, we had to first change the culture of America. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I developed Race for the Cure. It was a positive way to deal with something like this. </font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>Q: How difficult was it for you to sit down and write this book? </b></font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>A: </b>It was difficult. If not for Joni Rodgers, who was the writer and co-author with me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I could have done it. Even though you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve walked through the sad places in your life and you come up to the other end, when you relive them over a period of eight, nine, or 10 months, it\xe2\x80\x99s very painful. I went through my own cancer, my sister Suzy\xe2\x80\x99s cancer, my father dying, and Norman with his tragedy. And yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve had so many blessings in my life and so many wonderful things happen. I had the opportunity to remember and believe and see all the wonderful things that have happened.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>Q: You write candidly about your relationships, especially the one you had with Norman. (The couple divorced, and he remarried before his death.) Was it your goal in the beginning to be so open?</b></font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>A:</b> I think Joni convinced me as we went along that it was very important to be as open and authentic as possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure it would be interesting to anybody. I wanted to be very open about my relationship, particularly with Norman, because they\xe2\x80\x99re not things you would announce to a community. I think there were people who were sad and curious as to why we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be together. I think I laid it out very clearly. It was very painful. I think I wanted to finally put that to bed. </font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>Q: What if this spurs more questions? </b></font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>A: </b>If it does, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be very happy to answer them. I wanted to make it very clear that he was not only a great love, but my husband, my role model, and a teacher. We loved each other until the day he died. </font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2"><b>Q: You write about how you meet women with cancer whom you end up loving.

So why continue?</b><b></b></font> <br>  <b><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></b> <br>  <font size="2"><b>A:</b> It\xe2\x80\x99s a promise I made. I promised her I would do this, and a promise shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taken lightly. Suzy has never given me a reason not to do this.</font> <br>  '

S"  Tricia,   <br>   <br> Almost all my lymph nodes were removed when I had my mastectomy. As a result, I suffer from lymphedema. I live in a hot climate and wearing a sleeve every day is just not feasible. I'm afraid of what can happen to my limb since I'm so young and have such bad swelling. This surgery takes a branch of lymph nodes, usually from the groin area, and transplants them to the arm pit so that they can pick up where I've lost the others. I meet with my surgeon tomorrow to get it scheduled.&nbsp; <br>  "

S"  Now on month 18 of Tamoxifen. &nbsp;Still having my usual 2 hot flashes every night and several more at random times during the day. &nbsp;My hair has started to fill in on top - there are tons of baby hairs now! &nbsp;I know I've gained weight due to the Tamoxifen - haven't really changed anything else that I do - and that is very bothersome. &nbsp;Still not crazy about the idea of 3 1/2 more years of this nonsense...

I didn't exercise any less and I didn't eat any more than when I was holding at 175, but in just 6 weeks I <b>gained 10 ugly pounds.... <br>  </b>(I would have written sooner, but I was in shock.) <br>   <br>  Okay, I've lost 5 of them so far by adding another 30 minutes of exercise a day to the hour of walking 3 miles an hour....

S'  I am sorry to hear about your problem with lack of hair. Have you discussed this with a dermatologist? The reason I ask is that there are several reasons for lack of hair growth besides chemo. Sometimes a lack of ferritin stores or&nbsp;malfunctioning thyroid gland can cause hair loss or lack of growth. Also, stress can cause alopecia, which causes hair to fall out in spots or all over, in some cases. <br>  &nbsp; <br>  I hope you can find an answer and solution to your situation. Keep us posted. <br>  '

S'  Good morning ladies!! &nbsp;I have had a whirlwind week. &nbsp;I have decided after much deliberation to transfer my care from a private clinic to one closer to home which luckily happens to be MD Anderson. &nbsp;I have met with a breast suregeon, genetics counselor, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist and reconstruction specialist and despite the very long road I have ahead of me (approx 2 years from first chemo to final reconstruction surgery) I am hopeful and optimistic.   <br>   <br> My new oncologist has suggested a change in my chemo regimen and I was hoping to get some feedback on it. &nbsp;I will be doing A/C three rounds 21 days apart beginning in June 20th (it is 4 total but I have already had one round elsewhere). &nbsp;I will have a two week break and then I will begin a weekly regimen of Taxol for 12 weeks. &nbsp;Now, during this 12 week/4 month &nbsp;period I will also be receiving a drug called Carboplatin every 21 days. &nbsp; <br>    <br>  I have seen in a lot of the threads on here talk of the ACT so it seems to be a pretty tried and true treatment regimen but has anyone had any experience with Carboplatin? &nbsp;If you have please let me know. &nbsp;I have looked it up online but I always prefer and appreciate real life experiences. Thank you!! <br>    <br>  Sarah Holloway age 32 <br>  Found 2/2014 <br>  Dx 5/13/2014 <br>  IDC stage IIIA grade 3 triple negative &nbsp;5.2 cm mass with lymph node involved&nbsp; <br>  '

S"  Hi. &nbsp;I got the news Friday that I have breast cancer. &nbsp;I'm deep into researching treatment options and meeting with various specialists. &nbsp;I'm leaning towards bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction, but a further surgery and radiation is potentially an option as well. &nbsp;My biggest issue currently is that I am a single mom with three kids, all three of whom have difficult medical conditions with my boys having autism as well. &nbsp;I've been on Lexapro for nearly five years and my doctor and I both agree it would be insane for me to go without an antidepressant given the difficulties of my daily life. &nbsp;Let's just say my narcissistic ex-husband might not fair well. &nbsp;:-) . &nbsp;She tried to find an alternative that wouldn't reduce the effectiveness of the Tamoxifen, but didn't come up with anything. &nbsp;I can't be the only person with this dilemma. &nbsp;I would appreciate any suggestions and want to say I am happy this forum exists.   <br>   <br> Thank you, <br>  Jena <br>  "

S'   <br>   <br>  As I discuss in detail in my recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cancer-Prevention-Guide-Human-Race/dp/1608446913/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race</a>, there is considerable research evidence linking low Vitamin D levels in the blood with a higher risk of some types of cancer, and colorectal cancer in particular.&nbsp; As I have discussed previously in this column, there is also some research evidence available to suggest that low levels of Vitamin D may, similarly, be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, as well as a possible increase in the risk of recurrence of prior breast cancers (although the results of still other studies have not supported these conclusions).&nbsp; Now, a new analysis of recent breast cancer prevention research studies suggests that higher levels of Vitamin D in the blood may indeed <i>significantly</i> decrease the risk of developing breast cancer.  <br>   <br>   <br>  Meta-analysis studies use powerful statistical formulas to combine the results of multiple smaller research studies into a single larger and more conclusive \xe2\x80\x9cmeta-study.\xe2\x80\x9d&nbsp; This form of statistical analysis is especially useful for evaluating clinical research studies that have utilized different research methods to arrive at their final conclusions.&nbsp; A new meta-analysis of 11 previously published breast cancer risk research studies has just been published, and this new comprehensive meta-analysis appears in the current issue of the journal <i>Anticancer Research</i>.  <br>  Following meta-analysis of the results of 11 different breast cancer risk studies, this new study determined that high-normal levels of Vitamin D in the blood were associated with a significantly lower risk of developing breast cancer when compared to low Vitamin D levels.&nbsp; Indeed, in this meta-analysis, a Vitamin D level of 47 ng/ml in the blood was associated with a whopping <i>50 percent reduction in breast cancer risk</i>, when compared to women who had very low blood levels of this hormone-like vitamin.&nbsp; (While there is no uniform agreement on \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d blood levels of Vitamin D, most experts recommend that Vitamin D levels be maintained in the 30 to 50 ng/ml range.)  <br>  &nbsp;  <br>  While increased Vitamin D intake has been repeatedly linked with a lower risk of some cancers, as well as a decreased risk of heart disease, excessive Vitamin D levels in the blood can cause serious illnesses, including kidney failure, calcium deposits throughout the body, gastrointestinal ulcers, and other serious health problems.&nbsp; Therefore, prior to beginning Vitamin D supplementation (or, indeed, before starting any new supplement or medication), please consult with your personal physician first!  <br>  &nbsp;  <br>  &nbsp;<font size="0">  <br>  </font><b>Disclaimer:&nbsp; As always, my advice to     readers is to seek the advice of your physician</b> <b><u>before</u></b>     <b>making any significant changes in medications, diet, or level of physical     activity</b>&nbsp;  <hr>  <br>  <b>&nbsp;</b>  <br>  <b>Dr.&nbsp;Wascher     is an oncologic surgeon, professor of surgery, cancer researcher, oncology consultant,     and a widely published author</b>&nbsp;  <hr>  <br>   <br>  <b>Send your feedback to Dr. Wascher at</b>: &nbsp;  <br>  &nbsp;  <br>  <a href="mailto:rwascher@doctorwascher.net"><b>rwascher@doctorwascher.net</b></a>  <br>  &nbsp;  <br>  <hr>  <br>  <b>&nbsp;</b>  <br>  <b><a href="http://doctorwascher.com/Doctor%20Wascher%20Bio%20-%202008.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Wascher\'s     Biography</a></b>  <br>  <b>&nbsp;</b>  <br>   <br>  <hr>  <br>  <b><a href="http://doctorwascher.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr.     Wascher\'s Home Page</a></b><b>&nbsp;</b>  <br>  <b> <br>  </b>           <hr>  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  '

S"  Not sure what to say about this. &nbsp; How close of a friend are you to her? &nbsp;What I mean is are you passing acquaintances or does your friendship go over several years where there are no secrets from each other? It is possible that she had changed her mind about the natural remedies and became scared enough to do the conventional ones. &nbsp;Not everyone is willing or able to explain all the details revolving around their diagnosis, treatment plan.   <br>   <br> The fact that she is telling a reporter this information instead &nbsp;of a friend is a little concerning. &nbsp;Did she choose this method to bring attention to the cause or promote her career? &nbsp;I know the question sounds harsh but as you said you thought her memory was impaired due to the differences in the stories. <br>    <br>  If you are really, truly good besties, then ask her about the inconsistencies. &nbsp;Tell her of your concerns and ask her what you can do for her if you are so inclined. &nbsp; <br>    <br>  I don't understand your comment about not being comfortable confronting her since you make your living in the comedy world part. &nbsp;As long as the question isn't being raised while someone is on stage or in front of any audience, while a little uncomfortable, it shouldn't be dramatic. <br>    <br>  If you still are not comfortable, then dismiss her statements and move forward. &nbsp; <br>  "

S"  I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. My advise is to give her time to digest this news. It's such a scary thing to be diagnosed, and I'm sure the second time around is much harder to wrap your head around. It took me several weeks to just accept I was going to have treatments for a breast cancer that was in Stage 1. Once your Mom has time to accept all that she has to face, she could very well be ready to accept the treatments available to her. If you've told her how you feel, just do it once, believe me she won't forget your words. Then, stand by her, love her and tell her you are there for her no matter what choices she makes. "

S'  Tricia, BARD 1 is a different gene from BRCA 1.  They do work together to suppress tumors, but the BRCA genes to the "heavy lifting" so people with the BARD 1 defect are not at as high a risk as those with BRCA defects.  The problem is that it so newly discovered that there is not good information on how high the risk is or what treatment options are recommended.  I guess it will be a learning game. '

S'  <b><font size="2">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</font></b> <br>  <b></b>&nbsp; <br>  <font size="2">September 20, 2010, By Kathleen Doheny</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">MONDAY, Sept. 20 (HealthDay News) -- Two new studies may help breast cancer patients and their doctors make treatment decisions involving immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">One study finds that about half of women who need radiation therapy after having had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction develop complications that require additional surgery. Another study finds that chemotherapy does not affect complication rates after mastectomy and immediate reconstruction.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Both reports are published in the September issue of the <i>Archives of Surgery</i>.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">The growing trend toward immediate reconstruction "has turned into a runaway train," said researcher Dr. Rodney Pommier, professor of surgery at Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. Some women, he said, would be better off delaying it.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Pommier and his colleagues evaluated 302 women who had mastectomies; of these, 152 had reconstruction, including 131 immediately, and 100 had radiation after the mastectomy.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Among those 100 who needed radiation, complications occurred in 44 percent of those who had immediate reconstruction, but only in 7 percent of those who did not have immediate reconstruction.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Both scenarios -- having radiation after mastectomy and having reconstruction done immediately -- strongly predicted the risk of complications, Pommier\'s team found. Radiation tripled the risk, and immediate reconstruction increased the risk eightfold.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Implants had to be removed in 31 percent of patients who had radiation after mastectomy, compared to just 6 percent of those who did not have to have radiation, the researchers reported.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">"We were surprised that one in three lost implants," he said. His team was also surprised at the complication rates overall. "I think it was known that complication rates [among those who need radiation] are fairly high, but I don\'t think they have been quantified," he noted.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">The results, Pommier said, have changed his thinking. He now suggests that having a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node (the first to receive drainage from a tumor) before deciding whether to have immediate reconstruction would be wise. "If the sentinel node is negative, there is a low probability they would get radiation," he explained.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">This biopsy is typically done at the start of the mastectomy, he said. But it can be done as a 30-minute outpatient procedure before the mastectomy is scheduled and before the reconstruction decision is made. In determining who will need radiation after mastectomy, doctors consider biopsy results as well as other factors, such as tumor size.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">In the second study, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, found that chemotherapy, either before or after the mastectomy and immediate reconstruction, had no bearing on complications and the need for more procedures.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Overall, 31 percent of 163 patients studied (some of whom received chemo, and some who did not) had a complication that required a return trip to the operating room. But the rate didn\'t differ based on whether the woman received chemo before surgery, after, or not at all.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">The two new studies are putting some numbers behind what doctors have observed in patients, said Dr. Joanne Mortimer, director of the women\'s cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who reviewed the findings.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">"I think they actually put in writing what physicians have appreciated clinically," she said.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">While immediate reconstruction can help a woman cope psychologically, Mortimer said, sometimes it is not best in the long run if a woman needs radiation.</font> <br>  '

S'  Just an update on my friend. This is so upsetting.. esp when none of this had to happen. &nbsp;They are looking at other options at this point.. but it doesn\'t look good at all. I really have a hard time understanding and wrapping my head around this. In our discussions we had talked about some of my "fallout" from chemo etc.. but ya know..I would do it all again. Here is a portion of what they posted on her FB page.   <br>   <br> On November 14th 2014, we took her to the ER at Portsmouth Naval Hospital to run some tests, as she had begun bloating to the point where she looked pregnant (a condition known as Ascites). Having difficulty breathing, moving, and in a considerable amount of pain, we decided that it was time to get everything checked out.  After a few tests and procedures, it was found that her cancer had spread to her Liver, Lungs, Adrenals, and Small Intestine, moving her Staging from Stage 1 to Stage 4. Her Liver is between 50%-75% compromised, and the fluid will continue to build in her abdomen until her Liver problems are addressed and corrected.  The Doctors at Portsmouth Naval could not offer her a timeline, nor any curative measures but Chemotherapy again, which we again respectfully declined. They have offered her Palliative Care to increase her comfort levels.  <br>  '

S'  As you know, the goal of treating breast cancer is to remove the cancer and keep it from coming back. With modern breast cancer treatment, rates of survival without recurrence continue to improve. Unfortunately, there is always a chance that breast cancer may come back, but the good news is that most people diagnosed with breast cancer will never have a recurrence. Proper follow-up medical care helps ensure any recurrence is treated right away. Find out more from our latest Komen Perspectives article below.&nbsp; <br>   <br>   <br>  What happens next \xe2\x80\x93 Follow-up care for breast cancer survivors</h1>  &nbsp; <br>  The goal of treating&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">early stage</font>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">locally advanced</font>&nbsp;breast cancer is to remove the cancer and keep it from coming back (called recurrence or relapse). With modern treatment, rates of survival without recurrence continue to improve. Unfortunately, there is always a chance that breast cancer may return. However most people diagnosed with breast cancer will never have a recurrence. Follow-up medical care helps ensure any recurrence is properly treated.&nbsp; <br>  Understanding more about breast cancer recurrence and what your follow-up care should (and should not) include may help you feel more in control of your health. It may also help you to discuss these topics with your health care provider. &nbsp; <br>  What are recurrence and metastasis?</h2> Breast cancer can recur at the original site (called recurrence or local recurrence), as well as spread to other parts of the body (called metastasis or distant recurrence). &nbsp; <br>  <ul><li><b>Recurrence</b>&nbsp;(local recurrence) means the original breast cancer has returned to the breast, chest or nearby&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">lymph nodes</font>. <br>      &nbsp;<li><b>Metastasis</b>&nbsp;(distant recurrence) means the original breast cancer has returned and spread to other parts of the body (most often to the bones, lungs, liver or brain). &nbsp; </ul> What are my chances of breast cancer recurrence?</h2> The chance of breast cancer recurrence varies from person to person. It depends on the original diagnosis, the types of treatment given and many other factors. Most recurrences occur within the first 10 years after treatment.<sup>1-2</sup>&nbsp; <br>  Talk to your health care provider about your chances of recurrence during follow-up visits. He/she will discuss any signs of recurrence and ask you about any symptoms or concerns you may have. &nbsp; <br>  Risk of a new breast cancer</h3> Breast cancer survivors have an increased risk of getting a new breast cancer (called a second primary breast cancer) compared to people who have never had breast cancer.<sup>3-4</sup>Unlike a breast cancer recurrence (a return of the first breast cancer), a second primary tumor is a new cancer unrelated to the first.&nbsp; <br>  Follow-up medical care for breast cancer survivors</h2> All breast cancer survivors should see their health care providers on a regular basis. This care consists of the primary care and health screenings that everyone should get. In addition, the goals of follow-up care for survivors include:&nbsp; <br>  <ul><li>Finding any breast cancer recurrence or metastasis &nbsp;<li>Finding any new breast cancer&nbsp;<li>Discussing behaviors that may lower the risk of recurrence and metastasis&nbsp;<li>Managing any side effects related to breast cancer treatment (such as<a href="http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/LateEffects.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">menopausal</font>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></a>)&nbsp;<li>Providing medical updates that might change your follow-up care&nbsp;<li>Providing emotional support&nbsp;<li>Providing time to ask questions and share concerns&nbsp; </ul> Tests included as part of routine follow-up care</h2> Health care providers use these tests to check for signs of recurrence:<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; <br>  <ul><li>Physical exams&nbsp;<li>Mammograms&nbsp; </ul> Follow-up care for survivors also includes:<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; <br>  <ul><li>Bone health tests &nbsp;<li>Pelvic exams (for women)&nbsp; </ul> Find&nbsp;<a href="http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/MedicalCareAfterTreatment.html#Figure6-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">a schedule of recommended care for breast cancer survivors</font></a>.&nbsp; <br>  How is a recurrence or metastasis found?&nbsp;</h2> Recurrence</h3> A breast cancer recurrence is usually found during a mammogram or a physical exam. If a recurrence is found, tests will be done to see if there is also metastasis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>  A recurrence is treated in much the same way as the first tumor. As with a first breast cancer, treatment varies from person to person. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/ReturnofCancerafterTreatment.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">treatment for breast cancer recurrence</font></a>.&nbsp; <br>  Metastasis</h3> Metastasis is usually found when symptoms are reported during follow-up office visits. Symptoms may include:&nbsp; <br>  <ul><li>Shortness of breath&nbsp;<li>Weight loss&nbsp;<li>Bone pain&nbsp; </ul> Don\'t panic if you have symptoms like weight change or bone pain. These are common and usually do not mean the breast cancer has spread. However, any of these symptoms should be discussed with your health care provider.&nbsp; <br>  Based on the symptoms above, tests will be done to check for metastases. The three main tests are:&nbsp; <br>  <ul><li>A blood test to check for breast cancer that may have spread to the liver lungs or bones&nbsp;<li>Bone scans to test for spread to the bone&nbsp;<li>X-rays or&nbsp;CT scans&nbsp;to test for spread to the chest, abdomen and liver&nbsp; </ul> <font color="#0000ff">Positron emission tomography (PET scans)</font>&nbsp;and other tests for metastases may be done, depending on a person\'s symptoms and the findings from the three main tests.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/TestsforMetastases.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tests for metastases</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>  Breast cancer most often metastasizes to the bones, lungs, liver or brain. Although it has spread to another part of the body, it is still considered and treated as breast cancer. For example, breast cancer that has spread to the bones is still breast cancer (not bone cancer) and is treated with breast cancer drugs, rather than treatments for a cancer that began in the bones.

Using these tests to check for recurrence or early metastases in people without symptoms does not increase survival.<sup>7</sup>After reviewing the scientific evidence, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asco.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</font></a>determined these tests should not be part of routine follow-up care for breast cancer survivors.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; <br>  In 2012, ASCO identified five ways health care providers could choose procedures more wisely to avoid using tests and treatments that have not been shown to benefit cancer patients (see all five&nbsp;<a href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-society-of-clinical-oncology/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">ASCO Choosing Wisely recommendations</font></a>). Two of the five recommendations were related to follow-up care for breast cancer survivors.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; <br>  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don\'t use PET scans, CT scans and bone scans to stage ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or early breast cancer (stage I or stage II) at low risk for metastasis. &nbsp; <br>  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don\'t use routine blood and imaging tests&nbsp;(other than mammography)&nbsp;for breast cancer survivors with no symptoms of metastasis. These tests include:&nbsp; <br>  <ul><li>Blood tests for biomarkers, such as CEA, CA 15-3 and CA 27-29 (<a href="http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/RecommendedTreatmentsforMetastaticBreastCancer.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">learn more about these tests</font></a>)&nbsp;<li>PET scans, CT scans and bone scans&nbsp; </ul> ASCO concluded these tests do not improve survival for people without symptoms of metastasis. And, for some people, these tests may cause harm by leading to more invasive tests, unneeded treatment and/or exposure to radiation.

Many survivors are afraid they still have breast cancer or that it will come back. These fears are normal. For some people, talking to a counselor or joining a support group can be helpful. Your provider may be able to help you find a counselor or support group.&nbsp; <br>  Recurrence</h3> If the breast cancer returns, you may have a strong emotional and physical effect.

"Once breast cancer treatment ends, it\'s important to establish a survivorship care plan with your health care team. Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment frequently result in long-lasting effects, impacting both physical and emotional health. Regular follow-up visits can help address long-term effects of treatment, and also detect recurrence. Communication is key \xe2\x80\x93 even in between visits if issues arise. Healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as physical activity and maintaining a healthy body weight have been shown to improve overall health and may also help reduce the risk of recurrence.

S'  Well it has been a crazy eight months but I feel like I\'ve gotten over the hump. After 2 surgeries, chemo, radiation and now onto the tamoxifen, I finally feel like a weight is off my shoulders. I know the doctor said not to use the word "cured" but at least I can say my treatment is complete!&nbsp;  <br>  &nbsp; <br>  I\'d just like to tell everyone out there&nbsp;in this fight,&nbsp;to hang in there. I firmly believe that attitude has been everything through this journey and it has given me&nbsp;a new appreciation for life.&nbsp; And there are just no words about how incredibly supportive my family has been...especially my husband. I can only hope that&nbsp;others out there are lucky enough to have a similar support system!&nbsp;I pray to God every day to thank him for my blessings. <br>  &nbsp; <br>  To those of you just starting this process, BEST OF LUCK TO YOU!!!&nbsp;Even though I don\'t know you all, I will continue to include you in prayers. <br>  &nbsp; <br>  '

At around the 10th one I started hurting so bad behind my breast I didn't think I would be able to finish. Turns out my Rad Dr. Diagnosed it as shingles brought on by a low white blood count. The swelling and pain is terrible. Even though I'm finished now they say nerve damage can continue to give me pain for months. Has anyone else had this happen or symptoms like shingles but was something else. If it was shingles how much longer before the pain goes away. Thanks so much for any help. "

"It\'s a huge protein. People were studying individual pieces but never got the full picture. Now we can really start to analyze its mechanisms.\xe2\x80\x9d</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">That analysis should help illuminate the underpinnings of breast and ovarian cancers and point the way, someday, to better prevention and treatment.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Heyer\'s paper joins two other papers, one also in <i>Nature Structural &amp;amp; Molecular Biology</i> and one in <i>Nature</i>, which detail the findings. All were published online Aug. 22.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Although the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were discovered some 15 years ago, scientists have had trouble deciphering their inner workings.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">"Everybody has a BRCA gene. You need it because it functions as a tumor-suppressor gene," explained Dr. Julia Smith, director of the Breast Cancer Screening and Prevention Program at NYU Cancer Institute in New York City. "Abnormal cells that could become tumor cells are popping up all the time and we have lots and lots of repair mechanisms and corrective mechanisms to bump off those cells so they can\'t divide and behave badly."</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Under normal circumstances, the BRCA gene would automatically correct those problems. </font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">"But if you have certain mutations in the BRCA gene, then one of the mechanisms of repair - the BRCA gene - is not functioning properly, so that cell is allowed to proliferate and grow out of control," Smith said. </font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">Over the course of several, often frustrating years, these scientists were able to purify the protein, which consists of 3,418 amino acids, to reveal some of its inner workings. </font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">As it turns out, BRCA2 binds with another protein, RAD51, in a specific way to make sure that any breaks in the DNA get fixed correctly.</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">"It\'s a basic science discovery but it has many implications," said Stephen Kowalczykowski, senior author of the paper appearing in <i>Nature</i> and distinguished professor of microbiology and molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Davis. "One would be that since we now know how the protein works, we can try to screen for therapeutic agents that could mitigate some of these problems."</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">"This illuminates a function of BRCA2 that\'s going to give new ideas to people who are involved in translational [lab-to-bedside] work," added Dr. Priscilla A. Furth, a professor of oncology and medicine at Lombardi Cancer Center of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. "This is good, solid, basic science that is going to put us on a firm ground as we now look at why we get cancers from the loss of BRCA2."</font> <br>  <font size="2">&nbsp;</font> <br>  <font size="2">"The more we can understand where the defect is the more we can try to correct it. RAD51 could be a molecule that we could target to make DNA repair actually effective in BRCA patients," Smith added. "That\'s the import of this work. It\'s not going to help us right now but we\'re moving more and more towards targeted therapy, designing treatments that target specific molecular abnormalities."</font> <br>  '

S"  I was diagnosed with TNIBC 9-17-12. 18 chemos first. I got so sick after the second I ended up in hospital for 8 days with excruciating pain in bowel and stomach. My tongue was raw. What I now know is that it was the lorazepam given to me by the oncologist that was killing me. For two years I got sicker and sicker. My hands throbbed and my feet were numb and froze. I thought it was the chemo. Nope it was a reaction to lorazepam. Now at 4 months into withdrawal my arm is normal again. My hands are almost back to normal. I could not button my clothes. My hands ached in the car. I had to wear heated booties to bed. Again, it was the lorazepam. My feet aren't as good as hands but are much better. All of the many physical symptoms I had from the drug are now gone. My bowel and stomach problems continued until I stopped the lorazepam. Just check your meds for any kind of benzodiazepine like Ativan or lorazepam. Check the FDA website or google the name of your drug. I did not think I would live until Christmas last August. My lungs ached and I had flu feelings always. My oncologist could not identify a single adverse drug event symptom. I was scoped, scanned, tested and retested. Nothing. I thought it was the cancer or the chemo. It was neither. I have spent the last 4 months researching this class of drugs. NO one should take a benzodiazepine for more than 2-4 weeks. "

S'  Does anyone know if herceptin can cause a "flare" in tumor markers? When I started the tamoxifen after I was diagnosed my doctor compared labs of before I started med and after and the numbers were up and he called it a flare. &nbsp;Numbers went down with next set of labs. I just had my second round of herceptin and after the news of a 25% decrease in tumor markers, the numbers have gone up again . '

S'  Hi Kris, please be sure to do your research before making a decision and there\'s no need to rush into anything right now, a good reliable site is <a href="http://www.breastcancer.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.breastcancer.org</a> and if you google Dr Susan Love foundation you should get some good info too. &nbsp;Do be aware that even a double mast won \'t ensure this never returns although the risk is less than a lumpectomy with rads but the overall survival stats are the same so its a big decision.   <br>   <br> I hope you\'ll keep us posted on what you decide, a lumpectomy was right for me and thankfully nine years later I have no regrets, you\'ll know more from your pathology report after surgery, good luck! <br>  '
